"A few weeks ago, we started experiencing what tech support representatives referred to as “intermittent” network disruptions in our area. Home internet and cell phone service both included. Customer service has not been able to give me any clear answers on when it will be resolved. After over a dozen phone calls over the last few weeks, I was finally told that the tower in our area is not able to be updated due to the owner of the land that the tower is on not allowing the technicians on to the property to complete the updates needed. We’ve been with T-Mobile for over 3 years now and have loved it and never had an overnight change like this. Now I feel like I’m getting the run around on whether or not they can even resolve the issue at any point in time. I work from home and I’m losing income because I cannot stay connected.

"New tablets

I currently have a pair of (32gb) Galaxy Tab A7+ on my account that are quite old and slowing down. They’re used by my kids for streaming video and learning apps like ABC Mouse, plus they like to take pictures with them which absolutely fill the onboard memory.

We are currently on the Go5GPlus plan and are locked in for another 11 months due to our phone promotions. 

I stopped by a local authorized retailer who said they have Galaxy Tab A9+5G available, but there’s no upgrade promotions - only for new lines.

QUESTIONS

— Is it true you now have to avoid any line removals for six months instead of three months to keep a new line promo?
— She suggested moving the insurance to the new tablets since the old ones won’t be in use anymore, and then she could put the old tablets on a lower plan, doing that would result in our bill only going up about seven dollars a month until the old tablets are removed, then our bill would actually drop lower than where it is now.

I’ve got a quick question about Magenta upgrades (we’re on a veteran/military plan, if that makes a difference).

I feel like T-Mobile must be using most of their bandwidth for 5G as LTE hardly ever works for me anymore. Sometimes I can have 2 or 3 bars of LTE and a text won’t even go through. Then it’ll switch to a bar of 5G and suddenly everything works again. Anyone else experiencing this?

"Planning to snatch a iPad Pro 11 M4 from T-Mobile with Go5G Next $5 tablet plan. But I don't need tablet plan as I can just tether. I don't see an option to buy without activating a new line.

2/ Does canceling impact my existing device promotion or future device promotion (e.g., next 90 days no phone financing etC)?

My local T-Mobile tower has been having some issues the whole day, between no data, or texts, it’s been a mess.

Verizon is on the same tower and is reporting an issue that should be fixed around 3:00 AM, is it possible that an issue caused both Verizon and T-Mobile to be down?? Any guesses on what it could be?

"I realize now that the two are nothing alike, with the exception of them both being trackers. I was told over the phone by a representative that it was like an AirTag, but it was better because it ran off of GPS and cellular. She didn’t mention how much bigger it was, and certainly didn’t mention that it needed to be charged. I specifically asked if it could be used as a tracker for my dog, and she mentioned nothing about having to take it off of my dog to charge it every few days. 

Attaching pictures for comparison if anyone else is curious. The picture on the package is most certainly NOT actual size. If the actual size was on the package, I would have never opened the box.

"For quite some time, I’ve raised concerns about rising monthly costs for four phone lines and inconsistent home internet. I was previously promised a lower internet rate, yet my bill continued to increase without explanation. This most recent situation—combined with broken promises in the past—made it clear that I needed to move on. I’m not sharing this to complain, but to help others make informed decisions.

Now after that nightmare, my wife starts getting calls from collection agency stating we owe T-Mobile $573.00 dollars for services rendered on an account that we never opened because we never received a product. I have emailed Mike Sievert and I plan on filing a BBB case as well as opening a case in small claims court. T-Mobile is the absolute worst company.",4,,"Nov. 4, 2025 Where to start.

"Months later looking into this we see they have been charging us every month since April still for services we don't have. Apparently there's an extra line that wasn't closed. Keep in mind we weren't able to intervene so we are thinking everything has been closed. Talking to CARE at the store over the phone they weren't helpful and blaming us saying they can't do anything so then we get transferred to someone ""higher up"" and said they can't do anything but credit our latest payment. She also tried to tell us everything was closed but a free line wasn't, which we never had access to or even had a phone or sim card supplied. Between carriers they failed to close the account completely when we signed documents that they were. All I wanted was credit to us since changing carriers in April and all I'm getting is rude and unhelpful reps. I asked to talk even higher up about this and they said sure it will take 72 hours to hear from anyone so keep an eye out on your phone for a call. This is very unprofessional and unacceptable that there is no one that can help with any of this and you have to patiently wait at your phone for a call from someone. We came in on a day off in person to get this resolved. I work a high stress environment healthcare job. I can't be by my phone every minute waiting for a call and dropping what I'm doing.

"T-Mobile didn’t just disappoint me, they turned my life upside down. What started as excitement to save money quickly became a nightmare I couldn’t escape. I trusted their promises, believing the plan would help keep my budget stable and my family connected.

I like T-Mobile. We moved our business account from Verizon to T-Mobile. The only problem I have with it is they do not carry the new phones. I've been waiting for the pixel 10 pro 256 GB.

The funny thing is is you can go to boost Mobile which is not a big carrier and they have the pixel 10 pro. You go to Verizon. They have it so you go to AT&T. They have it. It's just really hard to get a phone from T-Mobile unless you purchase it straight from the manufacturer.

"My service with T-Mobile was fine until I cancelled my plan when I found a better price elsewhere. When I first started my service with T-Mobile, I needed 2 lines for my son and I. They had a package with a 3rd “free” line that I never used and never connected to a phone. When I ported over the 2 active lines to a new carrier, T-Mobile started charging me $68/month for the 3rd never used “free” line. They said when the other two lines were ported to AT&T, the free line was no longer free. After my call with them, they still proceeded to charge me for another month. This is super shady in my opinion. Anything to make a buck. Well good for you, T-Mobile. You made an extra $204 off of me, but at what cost?

I was subsequently told that I was billed for Aug/September month of service, which I didn't even order until 9/23/25- never activated or opened equipment. Then the CS rep said ""It 'may' affect your credit, as the payment was over 30 days late."". I got LIVID - I said ""Absolutely not! If this impacts my credit in any way, we're going to have a VERY BIG problem!"" - First, no payment should have been due whatsoever- much less for a billing period before I even ordered the service. Second, the auto-pay should have never been deducted from my account for service that was cancelled and I was expecting a refund for!

When I called, customer service basically told me it was my fault for removing the add-ons myself instead of calling them, and that “add-ons aren’t prorated.” I was told I’m supposed to cancel exactly at the end of the billing cycle, or I get billed anyway.

"1. Baited With Lies, Trapped With Fees They roped me in with a promotional offer they had no intention of honoring. “Free phone with trade-in,” they said. “No activation fees.” “Guaranteed coverage.” Not a single one of those claims turned out to be true. When I brought it up? Suddenly the promotion “didn’t apply to my area” or “wasn’t properly applied at signup.” Their answer? Too bad — pay up or face penalties. 2. Customer Service is a Joke (If You Can Even Reach Them) Calling T-Mobile support is like entering a black hole. You explain your issue five times to five different reps, none of whom can access the same notes. Promises of callbacks and escalation are just empty scripts. You’re met with fake apologies and robotic empathy, but never any actual solutions. It’s like being told “we care” while they stab you in the back with another fee. 3. Dispute Resolution is a Total Scam Tried to escalate my issue? Good luck. Once they’ve got your money, they hide behind “terms and conditions” you never saw. Disputes go nowhere. You're either ignored, misdirected, or gaslit into thinking you misunderstood the offer. They turn their own false advertising into your mistake. 4. Product Guarantees are Meaningless Their so-called satisfaction guarantee is a trap. I returned a device within the window — in perfect condition — and still got hit with a “restocking fee,” late return charge, and mysteriously lost trade-in credit. You can beg, plead, provide receipts — they don’t care. Once you're in the system, you're just another monthly dollar sign. 5. Deliveries and Timelines? Completely Unreliable! If they tell you “2-day shipping,” expect two weeks and a dozen excuses. “The system glitched,” “warehouse delay,” “shipping partner issue,” — they have a script for every delay. Meanwhile, your bill starts immediately, whether you have the product or not. 6. Threats, Penalties, and Intimidation Tried to cancel after being completely misled? They hit me with a termination fee, an equipment non-return fee (even though I returned the device), and a threat to send it to collections if I didn’t pay immediately. All because I refused to keep paying for a service they failed to provide. BOTTOM LINE: T-Mobile is a dishonest, manipulative company that uses false advertising to pull you in, delivers none of what they promise, then holds you financially hostage when you try to leave. If you value your time, money, sanity — run. There are far better carriers out there who treat their customers like people, not ATM machines. I wish someone had warned me before I made the mistake.

"1 star which they don’t deserve, but you have to leave at least one star to write a review. So, I’m very disappointed with T-Mobile’s handling of my account closure. I called in July to close my entire account, which had two phone numbers on it. One of those lines had already been disconnected a month earlier, and I only needed the unlock code for the other phone so I could switch to a different carrier. During my call, I clearly stated that I wanted the entire account closed. However, T-Mobile only canceled one number and left the other line active — without my knowledge or consent. Now I’m being told I owe $262 for a service I did not use and specifically requested to be canceled. I do not believe I should be held responsible for this charge. I acted in good faith, followed the proper steps, and trusted that T-Mobile would handle the closure correctly.

"Well, by July I call cus/serv asking why? I knew my payments would be different but why. Over 2 hours on the line, they explain it was their error blah, blah, then they were charging for insurance for Razor 2025 on the wrong tier for another line I took noticed and that was supposed to be  resolved. In August bill was even hire this time, although I decided to removed the insurance on the new phone, which by the way was paid in full during the Convo in July. Same exact story, I ask why am I being charge for data for the 4th line, apparently I am in a grandfather plan and at the store they didn't even say there would be additional charges for the new line. Again another adjustment fix the data charge so I wouldn't be charged going forward. I was told all lines are the same on this plan. You can't make this stuff up. A week or so later, on the 4th line, we couldn't get online, it was saying need to use our WI-FI, my first thought was they removed the data completely on that line. I called again only to confirm my suspension was 1000%correct😡 so that was fixed. September, Lo and behold, my bill again was incorrect. I should be paying $137.15, my bill was over $155 and some change. Let the record show all these calls are made on the 16th of each month, again, another representative spoke with me. I gave all their names and the so-called manager that I never heard from since August, but that is another story for another day. They assured I should not have any more issues in October every was corrected. In September paid my bill. Wouldn't you know, yesterday 10/16/25, my bill was incorrect again. Oh yeah, my insurance for one of the other line was still being charged on two different tiers, which I never received an answer about that😡, but whatever. I was told nothing has change, it is taxed that made the cost go up. Correct me if I am wrong from a person that has worked in call centers in the past, when there are going to be any changes with services, communication are sent out and just to be sure, cust/serv reps has a script to mention this info to the customers during calls. I was like, ""Wait, you mean to tell me tax was added from last month to this month."" I was so disappointed, disgusted by that point I removed the insurance from the line that was being charged on 2 flipping tiers. The rep told me the amount my November bill will be. I can assure you it will be wrong again. At this point, by November, my family and I was planning to upgrade with 2 new phones, HELL NO. I am unsure who's worse, T-MOBILE or XFINITY.

"I gave the young lady all the documentation, the copy of my mother's driver's license, and our joint account information, believing that all was well. Instead, my mother began to get past due text messages and became so discouraged that she was in tears. I told my Mom that this had already been handled and that there was nothing to worry about, and that I would call T-Mobile to make sure. I called the store and actually spoke to the lady who helped me (she remembered me bringing in the needed items) but she said she couldn't help me over the phone and said that I would need to come in...again. I explained that it is not easy for me to do this all over again and pleaded with her to help me over the phone...no such luck. So, I drove all the way back to the store and spoke to a gentleman there who said that he couldn't help me because I wasn't on her account. I explained to him that I had been there just a week or two earlier and that I was told that I would be added to her account so that I could help my mother since she was no longer able. He said again, that since I wasn't on the account, he couldn't help me. I showed him my POA documents, but he wouldn't even look at them and just kept saying that he couldn't help me. I asked him if he could call someone else who could, and he said no because he doesn't have access to her account (what?) So I left (not very happily) and called customer service. I spoke to a very nice young man who seemed very sympathetic and apologetic and began to find ways to help me get the POA issues handled. Unfortunately, T-Mobile is not good at working with these things, so I had to go online and print out one of their request forms, complete it, and email back all the POA docs, their form, and send a copy of my driver's license.

I was with AT/T & dealt with their overbilling for 3 yrs.

"Trying to find anything about your account on the app or online is next to impossible. For example, I have three devices on payment plans that I pay for monthly, however, when I try to look up the remaining balances on them, only the primary device is shown.

T-Mobile is the absolute worst internet service available. First off, it is constantly cutting out and disconnecting from our devices although the router says that our reception is ""very good"". None of our devices connect automatically to the wi-fi, even though they're set to do so. I have to manually connect our phones, TVs, my laptop, etc. several times throughout the day. I also live in a very, very small house, yet not all of our rooms get reception. When initially connecting to the router, following the directions did not work, so I had to call for help. The tech had me go in the app, and set up a new name and password for our wi-fi, which I did following his exact instructions. Now both the new name and the original name that's printed on the router show up in the list of options. If you connect to the new name, the service is spotty at best, but if you connect to the original, you get a slighty better connection. It absolutely does not make any sense!

Switch phones out. A month later T-Mobile add over 400 dollars to my bill saying the warranty didn’t accept my exchange due to the hair line crack and that you have to pay for the phone. The problem I have with that is T-Mobile charging over 400 dollars for a refurbished phone that’s worth less than 150. And they won’t even send you back your old phone so you can give them back a phone that’s not worth the price. If I would have known they were going to charge over 400 dollars for an iPhone 11.

That team member tried to text me a link so I could take a picture of my ID, then upload back to him.

This afternoon, two weeks later, I receive a notification from my bank that they charged my debit card for a month of internet service that we cancelled 5 days into the free trial. After doing some research, they are notorious for doing this. Some people never get their money back. Other only get part of their money back and another bill. I have filed a complaint with the BBB and will also be disputing the charge with my bank as I have every single email from them proving I was well within the 15 day free trial and that they should have never charged me. We are absolutely not impressed with T-Mobile and as soon as our phones are paid off, we will be switching to Verizon. Save yourself some headaches and run as fast as you can the other direction!

"Was a T-Mobile customer for a few years. I will never go back. Terrible and rude customer service. Many of the Representatives simply could not help with any problems or questions regarding bill or account. Mainly because T- Mobile requires in-store verification A LOT! T-MOBILE STOLE MONEY FROM MY ACCOUNT! T-Mobile refused to pay back the money. One representative said it was because I was no longer a customer so they had no way to return the funds another said that I owed them the money because when I transferred to a new service provider, I did not specifically LIST every number that was to be cancelled. Me just saying ""the accounts are cancelled now"" allowed them to interpret that I was only talking about the three accounts whose phone numbers I was transferring to a different provider.

"Traveling on a train from Fargo to Montana, I lost coverage as soon as we hit Minot. My family was staying in a little town called Eureka, Fortine MT. My phone was worthless. I couldn't connect to my family's Wi-Fi signal, and there was an emergency, and I had to run down a mountain to get to a neighbor to use their phone (my abusive ex had assaulted me while I was visiting my kids and I needed to make quick arrangements to get back home). Sorry for personal details, but these were my real life experiences that called for a dependable network. I'm stuck in a contract that involved a 'promo' deal for a new z-flip 6 with a low cost payment plan and it included a 'free' Samsung smart watch as part of the deal. I was slapped with so many surprise fees, including 60$ just to help me transfer my apps to the new phone. I'm bogged down with an approximately 300$ bill every month on a 2 year payment plan. Plus one of the perks of being a T mobile customer is free Netflix, and when I took the 'promo' deal, it cancelled out my free Netflix without even telling me. Which is just stupid. I live out at a lake about 7 miles out of town, and if there are people visiting the lake with their mobile Wi-Fi, it sucks up all of my bandwidth or broadband, whichever one means that my devices load slowly if at all and just buffer forever. This is far from the coverage they advertise and if I can lose coverage at 30 miles from town or have spotty coverage at 7 miles from town, it's BS.

"I received a bill electronically on the first of the month. The first bill listed already listed my charges with a 15-dollar late fee. The bill had arrived in less than 14 days from the start of service, meaning that not only was I being charged a 15 dollar late fee, but I was being charged for the first month which was supposed to be free. I called customer service, and got bounced from supervisor to supervisor to support person. I was told each time that the charges were correct, and I stated that they were not because the first day of service was much less than one month, but I was billed a full month's service when I wasn't supposed to be billed until the next month. This went on for almost 2 hours, sitting on hold and being cut off. I finally gave up and simply paid the charges and the late fee. But it didn't end there. Next month, I receive my T-Mobile Home internet bill via email. Same thing, it shows current charges, a $5 fee for NOT USING AUTOPAY (This WAS disclosed in the contract so no issues) and yes, another $15 dollar late fee. The bill WASN'T DUE YET! IT WAS NOT LATE. I angrily paid the bill. Next month, bill comes. Finally, the bill is $50 plus the $5 manual payment charge. It seems like they finally got it fixed, I logged the erroneous billing errors and was intending to add them up for one time-consuming customer service complaint and or written request. Another month passes. The bill comes electronically via email, on a winter day during a snowstorm, and I arrive home from work at about 10 PM. I wake up the next morning, check my email and there is the email with a link to make payment. Yep, you probably already guessed it. Your bill is past due, we are charging a late fee. Wow you stingy bastards. OK I am a day late, so I simply pay the fee. Done. Never dealt with a company that was so picky. Fine, I will make sure that that bill gets paid on the due day exactly. Bill comes next month. I receive the bill a few days in advance via email. I am again being charged a $15 late fee when the bill is not even due yet. It looks like they double-bill late fees. If you are late once, the next bill is automatically late. This seems like some really bad computer programming, or somebody doing programming that does not understand how billing systems work. The company punishes its customers by fraudulent false billing, then puts the burden on the consumer to correct its errors, spending hours of their time waiting on the telephone. But it still doesn't end there. I moved to a new location in another county. It is rural as well. I brought my device with me which worked there as well.  According to the contract, you must notify T-Mobile of the location change as they apparently have to allocate bandwidth use for the specific tower you are on. I don't know if that is really true. The device worked for a few weeks. Then I kept getting signal but no internet. My new location had available Spectrum Fiber internet. So I decided that it was time to get rid of T-Mobile home internet. So, as I had retained the original box and packaging per the contract, I returned the device to the T-Mobile store and told them I am discontinuing their service. I made sure they deactivated the device. As I was leaving the store, the representative told me to call customer service to close my T-Mobile account. As this wasn't my responsibility, I did not as the device was deactivated and there was no service. I did my due diligence to notify T-Mobile in person that I was terminating service and turned in my equipment per the contract. Oh yes, I get another bill, charging me a late fee and telling me that my phone is going to be disconnected if I don't make a payment. It was a pretty good laugh. I was now being billed for service I didn't have, especially since I no longer possessed the modem device. The message was also suspect because it was discussing phone service. The answer was....DELETE message. I got a second email a month later saying that they were going to disconnect my service. I had the receipt that I had returned the device. Lol, turn off my service.... It is now August of 2025, more than a year later, I receive an email from a collection agency called Sequium. ""We received your email address from T-MOBILE. We are reaching out to you to provide a convenient customer experience. Our service is designed to be your guide to resolving this matter completely. Your T-MOBILE account information is available for your review."" Yep, now they are trying to collect for a bill for service that was not active, because their automated billing system continued to bill for service which was inactive. While credit reporting agencies no longer accept credit information from cell phone carriers, it wouldn't matter anyway because I don't have a credit report and therefore, there is not much they can do. However, there is one thing for sure, I will NEVER USE T-Mobile service AGAIN. WHAT A BUNCH OF FRAUDS! It is one thing to make a billing mistake, it is another to make the same mistake to take advantage of the customer. Time is money, and T-Mobile's negligence in willfully failing to correct errors in billing is a cause for me to sue for damages, including the amount of time spent contacting customer service, as well as negligence in billing for services that are inoperable.",2,,"Aug. 17, 2025 I was introduced to T","Omro, WI"

"We’ve had T-Mobile for probably close to 20 years in total. We moved into an area in Mesa AZ that does not offer the 5G internet and the service is so bad with getting only 1 and 2 bars.

So when Cox has an outage we have no internet or good phone service.

At least that was until T-Mobile used my autopay to pull $2,217.03 out of our account to pay off the phones. I authorized T-Mobile to pull monthly bills out of autopay, not anything else. I called and spoke with customer service as soon as I saw the funds being withdrawn. They said, ""We can not stop the payment on our end, but once it processes we would be more than happy to provide you with a refund."" So I waited, the next day I call back, fund have cleared, they submitted a request to have fund refunded. I again waited, a few days go past and I call back, check the status of the refund, it was declined, due the fact I was no longer an active customer and did not have surplus balance.

They tried telling me that they will always send me a refurbished phone when I get a replacement phone from my insurance. That is absolutely ridiculous. I've never been mistreated by some company that I've been loyal to and paid on time every month for the last 13 to 15 years. The last time that they did this to me they made it right by having me go into the store and getting a new phone from the store, same phone just new out of the box from the T-Mobile store. This time they're trying to tell me that they cannot do that that they have to ship it to me and it will be refurbished. I don't know what T-Mobile did to change their policy or what they're doing now but this is not right and I can honestly tell you that I won't be going through them anymore.

Turns out, they don't actually have coverage there, but they are ""looking into expanding it."" First, I was told to wait 5 or 6 weeks. By end of long conversation, I was told to check back in 1 or 2 weeks or the engineer would call me on Friday (in a few days). Didn't happen. Meanwhile, I switched back to Verizon. So I paid my ""final bill"" over the phone with T-mobile, then turned in my unused iPad device in their required window. I had had to keep using my old iPhone 14 because they couldn't activate a new one over the phone, and I wasn't going to drive 90 miles to a store. Long story short, after I cancelled, I did drive 90 miles to a store, tried to turn in my iPad and the store, even though it was an official corporate store, could only help me print out a label as a courtesy, so I could drop it off at a UPS store.

I had to keep trying with a passcode after I was sent a form; rep could still not see that I was logged in.

"Original Review: July 26, 2025 I recently had a problem with my phone, so I went to Walmart to get a temporary phone. They recommended T-Mobile since they had a special of ‘free phone’ with a sign-up service. Walmart sold me the package for $54. Three days later I call T-Mobile to get the account & porting pin numbers and asked again if I had to return the phone – NO. Okay, I have the phone which is useless to me since I got the phone I wanted and switched back to my preferred carrier. I then got a bill from T-Mobile stating that I owed them 1 month of billing service. I called and not one person could give me a reason as to WHY I was billed for a *SECOND* month that I did not use. I only had the phone to use for **THREE DAYS**. Their billing cycle is the 19th – 20th (ex: June to July) and not informed of this otherwise I would have waited 1 day to get the phone. I called in to verify what was happening and was told that they would zero out since they could see I had the phone for only 3 days. But I later got a bill stating that I owed them for the phone (told it was $50 but the bill was for $67), plus the month of July (which I did not use) and late fees. Every time I called in, I asked if I had to return the phone and each reply was NO. I do not understand why everyone told me it was free and to keep but then I billed for it. When I called and spoke with a manager in their billing department, I was told that I should return the phone to Walmart and have them call T-Mobile and they would help resolve the issue. I asked if anyone at T-Mobile would be in the office to handle this and was told YES. Guess what? They lied. No one is in the billing office on weekends. Also, be advised that Walmart’s policy of returning the phone is **15 days** and I was not advised of it. T-Mobile would not send me an RMA label to return the phone whereas other companies do. Sounds like they are trying to accuse me of stealing their equipment. T-Mobile is trying to force me to pay $79.11 for a service I did not use. I did not request a refund when the actual amount for billed services was $1.80. T-Mobile offers may sound good, but BUYER BEWARE!!!",3,,,"East Syracuse, NY"
"It’s a scam. Profit before People is how they operate. Tried to cancel my daughter’s service plan and they won’t cancel it until the end of the billing cycle, in which they will charge me again! Don’t let these scammers trap you. RUN!",26,,"July 26, 2025 It","South Burlington, VT"
If there's the death of your son will they at least give you the grace of 3 days even tho I'm on a payment arrangement even tho I've been a customer for 6 years and even tho I am the one paying the bill and I've always paid. My payment is due on July 29 2025. I Asked for an extension till the first. Yes I had to go with a payment arrangement.  My son died for the sake of God. Please. I can't believe it. Even a job would give you the grace but not T-Mobile. Geez.,26,,"July 26, 2025 If there","Eaton, CO"
"Received cellphone from T-Mobile June 30. Returned July 4. Reception was bad, was told by sales rep to try it then decide. When returning it on July 4 was told everything was canceled I did not have to do nothing. Then on July 19th I received bill for 50.29.  So I called t mobile and I was hung up on 2 times and you are put on hold forever to get through finally and got to talk to someone they kept sending me to the store so they could make sure I was the right person. Finally got the store manager to call and she got it canceled but they still want to charge for a whole month and I didn't even have the phone. The manager tried to get it prorated but t mobile would not do it, the manager of the store even said they should have reimbursed me my money, so my experience is stay away from t mobile.",26,,"July 26, 2025 Received cellphone from T","Mount Solon, VA"
