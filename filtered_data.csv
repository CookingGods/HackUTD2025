"New Orleans, LA",2025-11-08 00:00:00,8,"I have been pleasantly surprised by TM! It's coverage and speed beat ATT in almost every area I frequent. Even at the camp. Good thing is if you are in a fringe area or dead zone it creates a uplink to Starlink so your phone doesn't have connectivity as long as you are outdoors. It works to automatically, so there is no manual toggling back and forth. This is really a game changer for cell Services. The service we are on is priced very competitively. Definitely saving us some real $$. My opinion is worth what u paid for it...$0. jJust a heads up! May be worth looking into. We are on the Magenta 55+",5,coverage,Positive,LA

"Kaufman, TX","Sept. 25, 2025 I would definitely give a zero star review if I could.

For example, I have three devices on payment plans that I pay for monthly, however, when I try to look up the remaining balances on them, only the primary device is shown. There's a way to find that info, but it basically requires spending an hour on the app clicking every single button and/or link available until you stumble on it. I also found out recently that, for some reason, I have been paying taxes on two inactive lines for awhile now--lines I do not need or want. Given all of this, I should have known better than to switch to them for internet services, but in a moment of frustration with my previous company, I made the switch. T-Mobile is the absolute worst internet service available. First off, it is constantly cutting out and disconnecting from our devices although the router says that our reception is ""very good"". None of our devices connect automatically to the wi-fi, even though they're set to do so. I have to manually connect our phones, TVs, my laptop, etc. several times throughout the day. I also live in a very, very small house, yet not all of our rooms get reception. When initially connecting to the router, following the directions did not work, so I had to call for help. The tech had me go in the app, and set up a new name and password for our wi-fi, which I did following his exact instructions. Now both the new name and the original name that's printed on the router show up in the list of options. If you connect to the new name, the service is spotty at best, but if you connect to the original, you get a slighty better connection. It absolutely does not make any sense! Sorry for the long review, but if you took the time to read all the way through, please learn from my mistakes and choose a better service, or at least do your own research before committing to T-Mobile. As for my family, we are washing our hands of this company as soon as our devices are paid off.

Dude is a straight up liar and has an attitude problem. Sir, if you do not like your job that much, then I suggest finding another one, rather than costing your company accounts. Unless customer retention is not a concern, then keep up the good work....I'm considering switching service now because of him after about 10 years. Keep up the good work ""sir"". Waiting on any response from that store front....7.30.25. The gentleman on the left is Gabriel.",4,activation,Negative,TX
"Smyrna, GA","July 30, 2025 They don",2,"They don't honor their offers. After confirming what I would pay to upgrade, which was supposed to be tax on the new phone, they tried to collect more from me. I cancelled the upgrade and the promotions offered. They still billed me for the lines for the promo trackers. Eventually cancelled my plan with them. I then received a 14 page bill in an oversized font for a grand total of $2. Customer service offered to pass my concern about wasted less on to the appropriate person. Gee, thanks.",0,billing,Negative,GA
"Aubrey, TX","July 30, 2025 Absolutely the worst. No customer service or care. They give you the runaround for months and never address any of the issues. Their service is not worth the price you pay or the price of working with them. Thanks Christa",4,Absolutely the worst. No customer service or care.

"Dallas, TX","July 30, 2025 I was with Sprint for 16 years until T",3,"Finally, after research, I switched to AT&T. I was ONE DAY into the billing cycle with T-Mobile when I switched. THEY INSIST THAT I HAVE TO PAY FOR THE WHOLE MONTH AND NOT PRORATE. I asked to speak with a manager and she said her manager authorized her to give me a 10% discount. LOL. They just confirmed I made the right decision switching. SO BEWARE IF YOU LEAVE T-MOBILE MAKE SURE YOU DO IT BEFORE THE NEXT BILLING PERIOD OR THEY WILL CHARGE YOU FOR THE WHOLE MONTH. What a disappointment T-Mobile turned out to be. I used to joke I've been with my cell phone company longer than men I've dated or was married. I feel like I just went through a major breakup. At least the divorce was only 90 bucks.",1,billing,Negative,TX

"Miami, FL","July 27, 2025 If I could give zero stars, I would. My recent experience with T",27,"To make matters worse, they didn’t even send the correct phones. I was supposed to receive three iPhone 16e devices, and instead they shipped two Samsung phones and an older model iPhone. How does that even happen on a brand new, documented order? When I called customer service, I spoke with a supervisor named Mark (Operator ID: **) who admitted it was their error, but told me my only options were to: • Wait for the phones to be misdelivered and stolen or returned, • Or pay $14.99 out of pocket to attempt to reroute the package via UPS myself. Why should I have to pay to fix THEIR mistake? Then, the inevitable happened. At 1:55 PM on July 26, someone fraudulently signed for my package at the old address—impersonating me. I filed a police report (Report #**) within the hour. T-Mobile told me they would “follow up on Monday.” Apparently, a theft and identity fraud case isn’t important enough to address over the weekend. To recap: • T-Mobile sent the WRONG PHONES • To the WRONG ADDRESS • Allowed someone ELSE to sign for them • Then refused to act urgently even after a police report was filed • Told me I would have to pay the taxes again if I wanted to reorder the phones in store • Offered no real accountability, no urgency, and no guarantee they would make this right T-Mobile has proven themselves to be irresponsible, disorganized, and completely untrustworthy. If this is how they treat new customers—sending expensive phones to incorrect addresses, ignoring fraud, and still asking for more money—imagine how they treat long-time customers. I’ve also contacted UPS, the Orange County Sheriff’s Office, and Fox 35 News. Someone needs to hold T-Mobile accountable. If you value your money, your time, or your identity: stay far away from T-Mobile.",1,billing,Negative,FL
