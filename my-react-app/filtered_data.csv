"Horrible service, they hold you on the phone for hours hoping you get so fed up you don't call back. Then you finally get to that point you have to fight to get somebody to cancel a line for you. What they say and what they do are two very different things at T-Mobile. I have now spent 6 hours on this trying to get resolved. Imagine getting charged for a promo and never getting the promo but still getting charged. Now after spending over an hour on the phone again today to get the promo removed that we never got, they tell me you now have to call billing to get your money back!!!! What a scam. Verizon here I come.",7,,11/7/2025,"Dover, NJ",5,scam,Negative,NJ
"I was initially quoted a bill of $103, but the actual charge was $230. Upon contacting T-Mobile, I was informed that the higher amount was only for the first month. However, the second bill also arrived at $230.",2,,11/5/2025,"Philadelphia, PA",3,contracts,Negative,PA
Can I charge way too much for postpaid accounts and I was told at Walmart when I purchased a T-Mobile phone there that there was prepaid service but I was told at the T-Mobile store that there's not a prepaid service but yeah I see reviews and stuff online for prepaid services so as of today I went back to AT&T because $30 a month is a lot better than 80 or 90 a month.,5,,11/5/2025,"Lynbrook, NY",3,contracts,Negative,NY
"They will let anyone set up an account, charge you for the start up and ship your equipment but good luck getting help activating it. Tech support barely speak English and give you the run around. When you finally get a supervisor they just tell you to go to your local store. It's been the worst experience with a cell phone company I've ever had.",4,,11/4/2025,"Zelienople, PA",1,reliability,Negative,PA
"My wife and I switched from Verizon to T-Mobile in good faith. We researched the service map and it indicated that our home was covered by “Extended G5 Area.” However, when we got home, we had one bar of service — our sound quality and signal reliability was poor. Dealing with the T-Mobile store and with customer service has been a nightmare. We are a dozen separate calls and over eight hours in. We are still stuck at “square one.”",2,,11/2/2025,"Red Bank, NJ",9,coverage,Negative,NJ
"Typical bait and switch, total waste of time. Their website shown some good promotion (bait), I was interested and started ordering there. T-Mobile website validated my numbers for porting in and I was able to add new plans with phones to the cart, and the cart shown the total prices with the promotion applied. The trick started when you submit the order, it said something wrong and I need to contact representative. Started a chat with an online agent, he confirmed the promotion then he asked me to fill out a form full with private information before he checked my number to validate if the porting qualified their promotion. So I end up giving all my information they ask, later was told that the network where I plan to port from does not qualify their promotion, then offered me something else (switch) I'm not interested at all. Total waste of time!",31,,10/31/2025,"Acton, MA",5,scam,Negative,MA
Automated system is garbage. Took me over 30 mins bc the automated voice did not recognize words and would only kick me to the paid representatives. Total scam. Then the system would not recognize the key strokes made. Dropping this carrier. I switched to Verizon. Free iPhone 16 pro. Try it.,29,,10/29/2025,"Camp Hill, PA",2,billing,Negative,PA
"Roger #** (supervisor) was very insulting on the phone, very unprofessional, accuse me of using raptorial question. Can somebody listen to the phone call? This phone call was today. My name is Victor **. Also spoke to an assistant named Universe. He was very unprofessional as well.",29,,10/29/2025,"Vineland, NJ",8,credit_card,Negative,NJ
What an awful company. I was a customer for year and they told be I qualified for a new iPhone 17. Before upgrading I was resolving an issue with my account because they entered the wrong EIN number when I opened the account on their end so I changed that and the company name per their recommendation. I was told they would honor the rate I had and nothing would change. Then my bill went up $15. After screaming at them they magically found the code to put me back to my old rate. Then I went to trade in my phone and they said they couldn't honor it on my new account. Shame on them. Biggest scam company ever.,29,,10/29/2025,"Stratford, CT",2,billing,Negative,CT
"IF you're thinking about going with this company DON'T, just signed up and weeks later my phone is shut off, and with a bill bigger than the monthly plan that also want me to pay to have my phone turned back on.

I was told by the customer service rep. Bert that he had spoke to management and was told because I have been go through so many problems with the s25 that they would give me the samsung galaxy s25 fe for free. I have had so much problems. Now all of sudden the customer service representative Bert called me and tells me that management changed their mind about giving me a new money. They are just liars. I wish sprint was still here. They would have never done this to me!!!!,27,,10/27/2025,"Brooklyn, NY",8,credit_card,Negative,NY
"I’ve been with T-Mobile for 10+ years. It used to feel customer-friendly. That’s no longer true. My bill kept going up, so I removed paid add-ons (like Netflix) in my account. The services stopped working right away — but my next bill still charged me for them. When I called, customer service basically told me it was my fault for removing the add-ons myself instead of calling them, and that “add-ons aren’t prorated.” I was told I’m supposed to cancel exactly at the end of the billing cycle, or I get billed anyway. After 23 minutes on the phone they finally issued a “one-time courtesy” credit. At this point T-Mobile feels like any big telecom: higher prices, blame the customer, no loyalty. I’m planning to move my lines elsewhere.",25,,10/25/2025,"Westwood, NJ",3,contracts,Negative,NJ
Hi. I've been a customer of T-Mobile for 20 yrs now and I have to say Noah at the Washington T-Mobile store has to be the most helpful and nicest representative that I've had the pleasure of dealing with.,24,,10/24/2025,"Hackettstown, NJ",7,customer_service,Positive,NJ
I am on my fourth year with T-Mobile. I have T-Mobile internet and my T-Mobile phone and I have a Moto phone. I have had zero problems with T-Mobile and my price is considerably less than what I used to play excuse me pay with Spectrum. I cannot be more satisfied unless they gave it to me for free!,23,,10/23/2025,"Albany, NY",6,customer_service,Positive,NY
"Customer service people are rude and unprofessional. I was on the phone with them for nearly 4 hours to fix small issue.

"I just want people to be aware that T-Mobile is scamming people. Sending a 748 bill for services never received on a device, never activated and returned with receipt. Double hard sales tax. Which my bank and refunded me... beware of fake text messages from Metro by T-Mobile as well.",22,,10/22/2025,"Quincy, MA",5,scam,Negative,MA
"I absolutely do not recommend this company. I am only waiting to finish paying off my “free” phone so I can leave T-Mobile as soon as possible. They also offered me a home internet service, which they described as a very good connection. Unfortunately, it turned out to be the worst home internet connection I have ever had. Never again with T-Mobile.",2,,10/21/2025,"West Babylon, NY",6,customer_service,Negative,NY
"We were frustrated with the poor service you received from T-Mobile at your address. We were upset that a supervisor suggested buying home internet for phone coverage and refused to provide his name or repeat his answer, then hung up on you. **What we've done so far: we are pay all the bills in time and T mobile supervisor ask us to buy internet to get services coverage so he want us to pay for another service to get the coverage from T-Mobile which we already paying for???",4,,10/21/2025,"Staten Island, NY",4,porting,Negative,NY
Finally a new internet option arrived in my town. I ordered the gateway and access point. Took a week to arrive. Difficult finding the setup instructions. Barcode on the package didn't go to instructions. Googled and got it on. Still needed to call service. She was friendly and got it working. Seemed okay until all my devices were connected. Started having problems all week. Returned it the store 7 days after setting it up and they sent me a bill for 79 bucks. They advertised free trial.,17,,10/17/2025,"Holden, MA",8,credit_card,Negative,MA
"It was a nightmare from the start, it was the first time we did a phone plan that included phone payments. The employees never seemed to know what's going on, we tried so many times to adjust things and we somehow always end up paying more. Then even when you pay the phone off, they threaten to lock it over anything. I just want to leave T-Mobile.",3,,10/16/2025,"New York, NY",3,contracts,Negative,NY
The worst service ever. T Mobile ruin my credit score. T Mobile has a bad customer service. T Mobile provide my phone number to scammers to used my credit card. The scam phone call don’t stop plus my phone is not working in my house.,12,,10/12/2025,"Irvington, NY",6,customer_service,Negative,NY
"📞⭐☆☆☆☆ — “T-Mobile: Where Logic Goes to Die”. Talking to T-Mobile customer service feels like entering a group chat with confused squirrels. I asked a simple question, got five different answers and a headache. If you enjoy repeating yourself while slowly losing faith in humanity, this is the hotline for you.",12,,10/12/2025,"Philadelphia, PA",6,customer_service,Negative,PA
"They also lied about their promotions, telling me the hotspot device was free under a deal, but I’ve been billed for it every single month. Their own representatives admit that their paperwork overrides what’s listed on the official T-Mobile website, which is fraudulent and misleading to customers. This company thrives on confusion, hidden fees, and false advertising. If you’re still with T-Mobile — record every conversation, save every bill, and take screenshots of everything. They change their story every time you call, and you’ll need proof when they try to deny what they said. I’ve filed complaints with the FCC and BBB, and I encourage anyone else who’s experienced these issues to do the same. Don’t fall for their so-called “free deals” or “limited-time offers.” Protect yourself and your money. T-Mobile is the definition of corporate deception. Once I leave, I’ll never look back.",2,,10/12/2025,"Queens, NY",5,scam,Negative,NY
"Very disappointed with T-Mobile. I have been a customer for over 10 years. I purchased the screen protector warranty for 2 iPhone 16 pro max and every time a screen protector is needed I have to go to several T-Mobile stores and they don’t have none then I have go to another cell phone carrier to purchase the screen protector spending more money that could have been applied to my T-Mobile bill, this is very unacceptable. I don’t recommend T-Mobile to nobody, not even my 95-year-old granddaughter. T-Mobile sucksssssssss.",10,,10/10/2025,"The Bronx, NY",6,customer_service,Negative,NY
"T-Mobile business customer service required us to visit our local retail store, only to be told retail store could do nothing and sent me back to customer service on the phone. Only the second time in 25 years of business that I've tried to file a Better Business Bureau report, unsuccessful because they don't cover businesses. If you are a small business, beware of T-Mobile. It may be cheaper initially, but trying to get out will cost you. I wish I could convey how awful it's been.",9,,10/9/2025,"Mount Holly Springs, PA",6,customer_service,Negative,PA
"Terrible customer service in person and online, both when purchasing and canceling. The customer service representative can't understand what you want and acts unkindly.

I will NEVER EVER RECOMMEND this company to anyone. We still have our original carrier of ATT, we don't have any phones w/ Tmobile. The worst experience ever. DON'T GO W/ TMOBILE!!!!",1,,10/1/2025,"Reading, PA",6,customer_service,Negative,PA
This company is a scam. DO NOT use them. Take your chance with any other company except T-MOBILE. If you don’t believe me just do your own research and read the reviews. It all in front your eyes. They scammed me and lock my number to T-Mobile.,29,,9/29/2025,"Brooklyn, NY",5,scam,Negative,NY
I called T-Mobile because I needed to upgrade my husband‘s phone. While on the call I told my customer service rep which her name was Liz that I just ordered a new iPhone and that I was told I couldn’t trade my current iPhone in because I had cracks on the back. She told me that as long as the phone did not have cracks on the screen and the water damage that I actually could trade the phone in so she went above and beyond and waited on hold for several minutes to speak to someone in the care team and then they even got a supervisor. I also spoke to Rowshila and April who are absolutely lovely. All of these ladies just went above and beyond to try and help me. I really appreciate all of their help.,27,,9/27/2025,"Sewell, NJ",7,customer_service,Positive,NJ
"Lana is a T-Mobile professional based in Queens, specifically Northern Blvd in Bayside. She is knowledgeable, patient, and so helpful.

Thank you Lana!!",26,,9/26/2025,"Holmes, NY",7,customer_service,Positive,NY
"After 17 years with T-Mobile, I finally decided to switch phone companies. I had two lines with them, and one of my phones was a trade-in. I paid the taxes at the time, and the trade-in value was applied to a Moto G 2025 worth $167.00, which had no balance remaining on my T-Mobile account. However, when I decided to switch companies, T-Mobile revoked my trade-in. They are now saying I owe $160.00 for the phone and are refusing to give me credit for the brand-new device I traded in. In other words, they took my phone and are still charging me for one that was already paid off. On top of that, they locked my phone. After 17 years as a loyal customer, this is the treatment I received. T-Mobile’s customer service showed no concern, only interest in signing up new accounts. At the end of the day, customers are not truly valued.",26,,9/26/2025,"New York, NY",3,contracts,Negative,NY
"Call sales marketing and bought new phones. Sales marketing and representative her name is Alexis. She was very, very helpful and patient and very knowledgeable. She make my day very understandable.

"After 7 phone calls including three ""supervisors"" they could not seem to solve this problem and send me another email with a packing slip that says I am shipping back 2 phones, and they insist that it is reflected in the shipping label but it does not say that in writing. In effect I am told to trust the person on the phone and ship back the two devices even though the paperwork only lists one. WHO DOES BUSINESS LIKE THIS?? Each phone is worth over $600.00. What is to stop someone in their warehouse from stealing one? I think next time around we will be shopping for a new provider.",25,,9/25/2025,"West Babylon, NY",8,credit_card,Negative,NY

"I just bought a new phone, 3 weeks later the screen failed. I work construction and this phone was extra sensitive. I went to the T Mobile store and they helped me with a warranty replacement. I waited 2 full weeks to find out it was on back order. Another 10 days goes by and I called. I was on hold 3 separate time for more than an hour each time. Twice after an hour of waiting I was disconnected from the call. Finally I was able to get a representative on the phone. They told me I have to go to the store where they helped me with the warranty. The woman who helped me could no locate the phone order. Now I have to pay to have a new phone.

"T Mobile promise you is all kind of rewards, especially if you refer people. But they always have an excuse. Why your referral is no good shame on t mobile? Their customer service sucks.

"T-Mobile ""super"" store, 1535 B'Way, NYC. Today Sept 24, 2025, I attempted to reach by phone to ask exact address. Response ""mailbox full."" I called another TMobile store location and got the exact address of the ""super"" store. I walked into the store. Did anyone greet me? No. Did anyone ask if I needed assistance? No. I walked around the store. Did anyone acknowledge me? No. Was the store full of customers? No. Was it full of employees on their phones? Yes. I asked for the Pixel section. Answer, ""It's over there."" I walked over to the section. I stood. Did anyone attempt to engage me in conversation? No. I walked out. I've been with TMobile 20+ years. With customer service of this caliber, perhaps, it's time I chose another provider.",24,,9/24/2025,"New York, NY",7,customer_service,Negative,NY
"I’ve been with T-Mobile for eight long aggravating years. My six security code never ever works, my calls go to voicemail 75% of the time, their TLife is complete garbage and contains no information that you need. I’m switching to another carrier and was told by TMobile that my account has not been authenticated, and I need to go to the store in order to get my transfer pen to transfer all four of my cell phones. Their customer service representatives are all from India, and you could hardly understand them and they are not helpful at all. Worst cell phone company!

Horrible service. Terrible actually. T-Mobile legitly robs people by fees. If I can switch I would have been left! Why would Sprint ever merge with this BS is beyond me. I'm legit spending a mortgage or rent on a T-Mobile bill. I legit have to pay T-Mobile two $300 every single week and just me struggling to pay that bill and certainly having compassion and setting them by me. As a customer within 10 years with T-Mobile you know you paid 200 and then they still cut my phone off and then charge me an additional $60 fee for restore my account like this is crazy.,2,,9/22/2025,"New York, NY",6,customer_service,Negative,NY
"People please listen to this message about T-Mobile customers care.

"Terrible service. Customer service is the worst. I called to cancel an iPad line and was told it would be cancelled. Months later I am still being charged for it. I called up to complain, customer service (from which ever country he was from) told me since there was data usage on the iPad, even if he were to process a refund. There would still be an automatic charge because of usage and if I would not pay that amount it would be reported to the credit bureau and affect my credit. As if the data usage that was incurred was my fault!!! Even while I was a customer with them It was the worst experience ever. It’s such a pleasure not to be with them anymore.",2,,9/16/2025,"Lakewood, NJ",2,billing,Negative,NJ

"What’s been even more disheartening is the endless, exhausting cycle of reaching out for help. I’ve spoken with countless customer service reps, managers, supervisors, and technicians over the past year, hoping for a resolution. Instead, I’ve been met with empty scripts, repetitive advice, and solutions that lead nowhere. It feels like shouting into the void, with no one truly listening or caring. It’s incredibly disappointing to realize that after two decades of loyalty, my trust in T-Mobile has been met with inefficiency, indifference, and a lack of genuine support. This experience has left me not just frustrated, but deeply disillusioned. Buyer beware— Loyalty means little when issues arise, and you may find yourself navigating the same disheartening path.",15,,9/15/2025,"Barnegat, NJ",6,customer_service,Negative,NJ
"I was immediately asked for my passcode, which I do not recall setting up. I explained my situation. My primary request was for immediate assistance in accessing my voicemail and restoring essential phone services, as my business cannot operate without them but they refused to help despite my urgent circumstances. They told me to log in and change my passcode. Frantic at the time, I was unable to remember my password (I rarely log in). I selected ""Forgot Password,"" expecting to receive a link by email. Instead, the screen said a text had been sent to my phone –the phone which is now likely lost at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. I was also told, dismissively, to visit a T-Mobile store, but all New York locations were closed at night. Shortly after, I remembered my password and tried to enter it, but at that point, I was locked out for 24 hours—not just a short time like most companies do. I spoke to someone in tech support, hoping they would lift the block. Surely, technology being what it is today, this can certainly be done, but they refused. Not being able to access your account --especially in such extenuating circumstances is pure madness! This ordeal has left me without sleep, extremely upset, and distressed. I urgently seek not just a resolution for my current situation, but a clear assurance from T-Mobile that no customer—especially someone running a critical business—will have to endure such frustration in the future.",15,,9/15/2025,"Sea Cliff, NY",4,porting,Negative,NY

"Sometimes, without warning, when I try to dial a number, a voice comes in to tell me that I have not paid my bill, and that I can do so now with a credit card. I am informed that one may place a ""Standing Order"" to have T-Mobile's bill automatically paid. HOWEVER, calling T-Mobile to do this required me to know my account number, but because of paperless billing, I don't have it. T-Mobile's customer service support directions say something like ""Just dial 611 on your phone and we'll solve your problem.""

The supervisor Joanne from T-Mobile was very rude. She’s like the worst person ever. Honestly not only did she not give me any information about my account but refuse to give me the number for collections and decided to give me an incorrect number. She literally decided to give me a 877-251-3780. That number leads to nothing. They have put phones line on my credit which I never used and I’ve told them that I never used this. I never activated the account but yet it’s showing on my credit. I would never use T-Mobile again and I was warned about this company. Don’t ever use T-Mobile. Comcast is a lot better than them honestly and I’ve been with them for many years.,9,,9/9/2025,"Philadelphia, PA",3,contracts,Negative,PA
"Hello My name is Janet and I am livid with T-Mobile. I called to acquire service and after making full payment of 66.75 for prepaid service it never came through. I called back several times from 12:30 to 5:30 pm with no avail in obtaining service. So, I finally asked for reimbursement. They advised me that they would reimburse minus the 10$ activation fee that I was never advised that that was not reimbursable. I advised them that my phone was never activated which they responded whether activated or not they will not reimburse the full amount paid. I asked to speak to a supervisor or manager and was told the system could not be overridden. How do you charge someone for service not provided??

"This means my ex has complete control over whether I can keep or transfer my own phone number. After 15 years of marriage, and despite having zero history of harming or misusing accounts, I’m treated like I can’t be trusted with my own service. It feels outdated, unfair, and frankly unsafe to give one person that much power over another’s independence. All I want is the freedom to manage my own phone line — without being at the mercy of someone else’s choices. T-Mobile, it’s 2025. There needs to be a better way for divorced or separated customers to reclaim their accounts and numbers. Until this changes, I can’t recommend T-Mobile to anyone in similar circumstances.",8,,9/8/2025,"Salem, MA",3,contracts,Negative,MA
"So basically they lie to you and hit buttons on their computer to adjust what you need at the moment knowing that next month their billing system automatically goes back to the overcharge, meaning I have to call customer service AGAIN FOR AN HOUR OF HEADACHE just for them to once again rig the system to give you what you deserve but never fixing the underlying problem. It almost seems like they hope for ignorance and that the customer doesn’t pay attention so they can take more of your money. Be cautious people when dealing with T-Mobile especially senior citizens who may not be computer savvy because they will definitely get you for your money. I’m very disappointed that after 5 years of being a member of T-Mobile that this is how we ended our relationship. T-Mobile the billion dollar company trying to rob customers for a petty $100. The part that really bothered me is that the rep knows it’s their fault but still told me that there was nothing he could do to change the current bill besides give me a $10 credit towards my next 6 bills because their billing system automatically generates??? Well that’s part of the problem and why I’m calling every month about my bill but they don’t want to own their part in it and do what’s right. Unfortunately I’m leaving T-Mobile and won’t recommend them to anyone ever again. They lack integrity",6,,9/6/2025,"Levittown, PA",5,scam,Negative,PA

I told them I canceled after all this crap started and got ""I understand why you're upset but you shouldn't have canceled the protection"". After being told my phone wasn't covered, why would I not cancel the protection! I will need to upgrade my phone, but if it most likely won't be with T-Mobile, they've already taken me for $200+ a year for a long time.

T-Mobile is the most dishonest company I have ever dealt with in my entire lifetime, of any product or service. I wish there was the no star option. T-Mobile does not, and I repeat does not, fulfill their price lock guarantees, assurances, or whatever you want to call them. Anything they say, from a selling standpoint, is completely meaningless.",4,,8/29/2025,"Philadelphia, PA",6,customer_service,Negative,PA
They messed up my invoice- issued a credit after I clarified the what the credit was for. Then charged me for the credit. I had a credit spoke to T-Mobile then was told I missed a payment ! I have screenshot. SMH.,27,,8/27/2025,"Syracuse, NY",4,porting,Negative,NY
"Worst customer service EVER. Always has been. Had T-Mobile in the early 209’s. Paid them. They triple billed me. Agreed they did then would not return the money. I switched to Sprint who had the best customer service ever. They sold to T Mobile - now back to incompetent customer service not willing to work with you. I ordered a phone. Was scheduled to arrive on the third business day. It is now the 5th business day and hasn’t even shipped yet but they won’t cancel it. Told me, ""Go buy a phone in the store and refuse this one when it arrives"" - which now they don’t know when it will even shipped yet - says they will refund me within 10 days after they get it back. That is the worst customer service ever. I’ll take poor quality phone calls at this point. If you want a cell phone company that doesn’t care about your business sign up with T Mobile.",26,,8/26/2025,"Hempstead, NY",6,customer_service,Negative,NY
Tmobile has the worst customer service. I cancelled service 2 months ago and ported to another carrier. They have now charged me 2 more months after that and when you call to try and find out what these bills and charges are for they can't give you that information because you are no longer a Tmobile customer. This makes no sense. I just want copies of bills to see what charges they are trying to charge for. I can't even log in any longer to stop auto payment on the account. Worst customer service ever. Don't make that switch. Stay away from Tmobile if you ever think you may need to switch carriers,2,,8/23/2025,"Levittown, PA",6,customer_service,Negative,PA
They like to bounce you around. Went to store to cancel. Store tells you call them. You call them. They tell you go to store. Store tells you need label numbers. They won't give it to you. Nobody wants to cancel back and forth game. Had enough I just stop paying! And I was a customer for over 4 years! Never again want this service.,22,,8/22/2025,"Reading, PA",2,billing,Negative,PA
"Very poor customer service, even the supervisors are dumb who do not understand simple questions and requests from the customers. Can't even provide purchase history or receipts of recent paid bills!!!!",21,,8/21/2025,"Webster, NY",1,reliability,Negative,NY
"T-Mobile use to. Be the best. They hit new lows. I would strongly advise not to use them. I have had more issues with the. Billing and the nasty people In cus service. They charge you fee after fee. They turn me phone off the bill was due in a week. I come complain and they say, ""Ok we will. Turn on phone,"" but don't return fees. Stay away from t mobile. 15 yr. I am done with them.",21,,8/21/2025,"Rochester, NY",6,customer_service,Negative,NY
That is what I give. This a customer over 2 decades. This is loyal honest answer. I can not do 0 stars cause is the lowest is 1 star. They have been misleading the ne gen for long time and nothing to show for and by the 611 is code for many phone carriers in North America not Just T- mobile.,21,,8/21/2025,"Paterson, NJ",1,reliability,Negative,NJ
"T mobile is the worst company I’ve ever worked with in my life. I traded in my iPhone 14 Pro for a iPhone 16 when I transferred over T mobile. T mobile stole my iPhone and said they’re no longer available to give me the trade in value for the traded in phone, making me pay full price for the new phone completely stealing my property that they have camera footage of us handing in that phone. NEVER AGAIN. DO NOT FALL FOR THIS COMPANY.",3,,8/19/2025,"Glen Mills, PA",6,customer_service,Negative,PA
How can I be held responsible for a phone your company lost? How can you just charge my card for something that has nothing to do with me? And have the nerve to tell me that I have to wait until your company finds the phone that they apparently lost? I am at a loss for words and disgusted by the fact that I have to wait for my $1500 refund for your companies wrong doing. I would never recommend T-Mobile to anyone. And if you currently have them please check your bills because they seem to be billing people for their screw ups.,4,,8/19/2025,"Queens, NY",5,scam,Negative,NY
"This might be the worse internet provider in America. Very slow WiFi speeds even though it says ""very good"". I can't even search stuff in Google. I mostly trust my spirit 5G than this. Can't even watch TV without a day of being frustrated of how slow the Wi-Fi is. $70 a month for this by the way. My cousins live far away from the Wi-Fi signals and have way better connection and speed, mind you they use Xfinity. McDonald's has some competition.",3,,8/19/2025,"Philadelphia, PA",9,coverage,Negative,PA
"I have a problem to finish setting up my plan. In total spent over 5 hours and it's not set up yet. They just billed me for plain, I tried calling them in to see what they can do for me, was on the phone with them for fifteen minutes, the representative knocked down the phone on me. Now I'm waiting to talk to them again and I will have to start the whole story (which I already told the other representatives several times) wish me good luck… #T-mobile not wishing for any one of you such a bad experience!",14,,8/14/2025,"Brooklyn, NY",4,porting,Negative,NY
"We have been with T-Mobile for YEARS. We've never had any billing or payment issues. This month, my husband got laid off. Instead of direct depositing his check, they mailed it. My payment is scheduled to come out tomorrow but it's not going to be there until Fri. I called T-Mobile FOUR TIMES trying to get someone to help me change the check date to Friday, but each time I got different people with extremely heavy Asian accents I couldn't understand. Basically the only thing I could understand was if the payment doesn't go through my service will be interrupted. She was reading strictly from a script and was unable to answer anything that wasn't on that script. Absolutely the worst customer service experience of my life. After years of loyal service, I think it's time to leave TMobile....unless I can learn to speak fluent Japanese.",13,,8/13/2025,"National Park, NJ",3,contracts,Negative,NJ
"Number one note, - prices rose over 2 years to 104.97- From 93.50 with tax included. Second note, Customer service will give you the run around - argue enough they offer to drop billing price to 45-55$ a month, for unlimited service. If you don't tell them to drop price they keep raising it. Third note: coverage is absolute trash comparing to countless other providers, do your research first. Fourth note: do not forget your account pin or they will make you go to store, they have countless ways of verifying your ID over the phone but they refuse to do so - stick with online -. Fifth and final note: Stores will try to upsell you things making you think its ""FREE"" - then stick it on a monthly reoccurring bill and hope you don't realize, and if you don't pay it all, and then ask for a refund, they will tell you ""they already refunded you the full amount"" and continue charging you monthly for the equipment instead of taking off the reoccurring charge. BE VERY WEARY OF ANYTHING THEY SAY IS FREE!!!!",3,,8/13/2025,"Mastic Beach, NY",2,billing,Negative,NY
"I paid off my phone early when I was only 8 of 22 installments in, and T-Mobile immediately cancelled the credits I was supposed to receive for my old phone trade-in. Customer service never warned me this would happen. As a result, I lost both my phone and the credits I was counting on. I feel misled and cheated by T-Mobile.",12,,8/12/2025,"Syracuse, NY",3,contracts,Negative,NY
We bought replacement UNLOCKED phones at full price elsewhere. Returned the new phones & they charged us an $85 re-stocking fee plus (the following month) and equipment fee on the phones we returned. I have spend hours on the phone with customer service. I think it MIGHT be resolved. This mess started on May 29th and continues at least until August 10th. My recommendation: NEVER believe the salesman at the kiosk. ALWAYS just buy unlocked phones paying the full amount. These promotions aren't worth the trouble. The unlocked phone gives you the ability to rapidly change carriers.,11,,8/11/2025,"Philadelphia, PA",2,billing,Negative,PA
"Horrible experience… T-mobile does NOT value their customers… Been a customer for over a decade and a representative misinformed me of promotions that ended in me having to pay original price for 2 phones now charges for 2 phones are applied to my bills. Never heard of anyone pay $2,0000 for phones with being committed to a company for over a decade… disappointing and disgusting service!!! Neither rep nor supervisor was able to assist. Now I have to write a letter to upper office",8,,8/8/2025,"Queens, NY",6,customer_service,Negative,NY
1. Called again and verified. Positive. 2. Received a bill on July 24th for $65.00. 3. Called 3 customer service reps who told me my account was closed and that should end it. 4. On Aug. 4th I spoke to 3 reps and a supervisor who said that I had nothing to worry about. Prior to speaking to the third rep.I received another bill for $9.17. So I spoke to a supervisor who tried to help me. During that call I received another bill via e mail for $65.00 and she could not explain it but said the account was closed and that should end it. So I asked for a confirmation e mail of which she said that she had no method of doing so. They could send bills via e mail but could not confirm a zero balance via e mail!!! 5. Now the FUN BEGINS!!! While talking to the supervisor I received another bill and an e mail from their collection agency and all the supervisor could say was NOTHING. I still have not received anything from T-mobile stating my account was closed or that I have a ZERO balance. My advice is: STAY AWAY FROM T-mobile!!! PS: Talking to my attorney about my credit score.,3,,8/4/2025,"Waretown, NJ",3,contracts,Negative,NJ
"Been with them for 27 years. Their customer service is the worst. Watch your bills if you charge to auto pay. They tack on charges that you don’t owe. When I mentioned I was a 26 yr customer the rep responded no I were not, I were with sprint! I didn’t do the M&A, they did! They raised my bill saying it was a promotion $12.00 and changed their username terms of a contract. They are liars and as soon as I pay off my phone I am done with them. I can’t take it. No one wants to be lied to and gaslit by some young punks in the Philippines who I can’t understand. They sound half dead or high.",4,,8/2/2025,"Brooklyn, NY",2,billing,Negative,NY
"I have been a happy solo T-Mobile customer since 2018. I recommended my son switch over to his own losing doesn’t fit, competitive plan today. We visited store number 2323 in downtown Trenton., NJ. Anthony was competent and expeditious, polite and engaging. Store manager Jonathan and other employees waited for the new phone to download an additional 30 minutes past closing time. While we waited, in their own words…”we became family!”. What a terrific company to be working for T-Mobile must be- I am proud to be a loyal customer. Plus- they comped us swag hats!!! :) Kudos to leadership and corporate, kudos to the team that pulls it off!",1,,8/1/2025,"Trenton, NJ",7,customer_service,Positive,NJ
"I have been a customer for years and now that I want to change carriers for a lower bill, I am treated like garbage by every rep I talk to. My son's phone is being held hostage and refuse to unlock it even though it is fully paid off. I just want to pay a final bill and be done. They don't even try to keep you as a customer. Absolute trash 🗑. Another time, I asked for an extension for a payment and was advised to borrow money from friends or family. Horrible advice for ""professionals"" to give out",12,,8/1/2025,"Philadelphia, PA",2,billing,Negative,PA
"During phone conversations, a recording comes on saying, ""This call is being recorded"". Most of my callers are insulted or simply hang up.
