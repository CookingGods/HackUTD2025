Home internet and cell phone service both included. Customer service has not been able to give me any clear answers on when it will be resolved. After over a dozen phone calls over the last few weeks, I was finally told that the tower in our area is not able to be updated due to the owner of the land that the tower is on not allowing the technicians on to the property to complete the updates needed. We’ve been with T-Mobile for over 3 years now and have loved it and never had an overnight change like this. Now I feel like I’m getting the run around on whether or not they can even resolve the issue at any point in time. I work from home and I’m losing income because I cannot stay connected. I cannot maintain a phone call, load a video on social media, stream Netflix, or run or update applications or games on my smart TV’s or video game console. I have"

I was told by the Tmobile store I went to today that if I called customer service they would reimburse me for cost of activation fee and SIM card by putting credits on my account for my next months phone bill.

I had to pay $10 activation fee and $10 for a new SIM card. I was told my old Tmobile sim which I brought was invalid.

So I call the customer service and the lady tells me they can’t do this. I asked to speak with a manager and she tells me manager is busy and would call me back.

I’m still waiting.

What can I do? I’ve been with Tmobile since 2013 and only left because they wouldn’t give me a cheaper phone plan and the Metro store said their $30 unlimited plan was exactly the same as Tmobile $50 prepaid.

Can I port a number from Verizon to T-Mobile that is tied up in pending changes w/Verizon?,2025-11-07 19:39:17,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/1or426v/can_i_port_a_number_from_verizon_to_tmobile_that/,"Completely frustrated with Verizon.  Ordered 4 lines to upgrade and for 3.5 weeks, 1 line has been stuck and the new phone hasn't shipped.  No one can fix it at Verizon.

I need to port 4 numbers from Verizon, 1 number is tied up in pending changes.  So, 3 lines have been processed, 1 is stuck.

Of the 3 processed - only 1 phone was sent back as a trade-in.  I have  possession of the upgraded phones for the other 2 lines but neither has been activated because I'm trying to figure out my next move here.

I'd like to cancel/return the 3 upgraded phones we received, within the 30 day return policy, and port all 4 numbers over to TMobile.  I'm hoping that cancelling the entire order of 4 upgrades will release the 1 that is stuck (won't be pending changes anymore, it will be cancelled).

If for some reason, that doesn't unstick the 1 number....is it possible to port it anyway?  What would stop a number from being ported?

  
ETA:  One of the upgraded phones is still within the 30 return win"

I stopped by a local authorized retailer who said they have Galaxy Tab A9+5G available, but there’s no upgrade promotions - only for new lines.

— Is it true you now have to avoid any line removals for six months instead of three months to keep a new line promo?
— She suggested moving the insurance to the new tablets since the old ones won’t be in use anymore, and then she could put the old tablets on a lower plan, doing that would result in our bill only going up about seven dollars a month until the old tablets are removed, then our bill would actually drop lower than where it is now.

I’ve got a quick question about Magenta upgrades (we’re on a veteran/military plan, if that makes a difference).

Last year around Black Friday, there was an amazing deal basically an “any trade-in for a flagship phone on us” kind of offer. One of the users on our plan really needs a new phone, but we’re not sure if that same deal (or something similar) will return this year.

If it’s expected to come back, he’s happy to wait. If not, he’ll go ahead and upgrade now.

Anyone have any insight or predictions? Thanks in advance! 🙏

Or should I convert the psim to esim on the Pixel 7 pro first and then only then do an esim based 7 pro to 10 pro transfer?

But I am very skeptical that it will this easy. Any advice is appreciated, dont want to get stuck in between with a deactivated 7 pro and a 10 pro that does not setup from psim to esim

Am I getting Applecare+ for free because I am paying for Protection 360?  If not I will just cancel the P360 as nearly everyone I have spoken with said that Applecare gets you the exact same benefits as P360.

Why Free T-Satellite 911 Requires An eSIM Download,2025-11-06 10:01:15,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/1opuywn/why_free_tsatellite_911_requires_an_esim_download/,"I've been asked this in a ton of DMs and I'm just posting it here because yes, I know about it, and I'm not copy-pasting to 55 people. No, I don't post a lot today. I'm busy, sorry.

T-Mobile is the one carrier left that accepts any device regardless of IMEI.

Which normally is a GOOD THING THAT MAKES THEM A LOT OF MONEY.

**Seriously, I have to stop there, and make clear, the other two carriers screwed this up horribly. So many people in the handset and IoT fleet world turned to T-Mobile because:**

**\* T-Mobile doesn't gatekeep by IMEI.**  
**\* T-Mobile doesn't require a useless VoLTE private key.**  
**\* T-Mobile doesn't suspend your line for SIM swapping into a device they feel is incompatible.... because, it often $#$!$#! isn't.**

Sigh, if you work in Seattle, read all of this in bold clearly. **Do not screw it all up in January. You will lose customers, I promise, because they'll be free agents again.**

In this one edge case, temporarily, it's a problem. You don't want devic"

LTE is the new 3G,2025-11-06 05:23:24,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/1opqhs0/lte_is_the_new_3g/,I feel like T-Mobile must be using most of their bandwidth for 5G as LTE hardly ever works for me anymore. Sometimes I can have 2 or 3 bars of LTE and a text won’t even go through. Then it’ll switch to a bar of 5G and suddenly everything works again. Anyone else experiencing this? My location is Hawaii.

Does canceling tablet line impact existing or future phone promotion?,2025-11-06 03:58:14,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/1opov5g/does_canceling_tablet_line_impact_existing_or/,"Planning to snatch a iPad Pro 11 M4 from T-Mobile with Go5G Next $5 tablet plan. But I don't need tablet plan as I can just tether. I don't see an option to buy without activating a new line. 

1/ Can I cancel the line immediately after I get the table? 

2/ Does canceling impact my existing device promotion or future device promotion (e.g., next 90 days no phone financing etC)? 

3/ As I am paying in full during cancelation, will the tablet be unlocked?

4/ If I order via Costco, will I be able to waive device connection charge for tablet?

Issues with local tower,2025-11-06 03:12:55,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/1opnxy0/issues_with_local_tower/,"Hey.

My local T-Mobile tower has been having some issues the whole day, between no data, or texts, it’s been a mess.

Verizon is on the same tower and is reporting an issue that should be fixed around 3:00 AM, is it possible that an issue caused both Verizon and T-Mobile to be down?? Any guesses on what it could be?

Thanks!"
SyncUp vs AirTag,2025-11-06 02:22:29,36,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1opmuh4,"I realize now that the two are nothing alike, with the exception of them both being trackers. I was told over the phone by a representative that it was like an AirTag, but it was better because it ran off of GPS and cellular. She didn’t mention how much bigger it was, and certainly didn’t mention that it needed to be charged. I specifically asked if it could be used as a tracker for my dog, and she mentioned nothing about having to take it off of my dog to charge it every few days. 

Attaching pictures for comparison if anyone else is curious. The picture on the package is most certainly NOT actual size. If the actual size was on the package, I would have never opened the box. I was hoping it would fit in our tag holder or an AirTag holder. "
International texts not going through,2025-11-06 00:59:27,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/1opl143/international_texts_not_going_through/,So up until recently I had been able to text my wife's family in the Philippines from the US. For the past month or so texts have not been going through. The steps I took to try and solve this are new phone's and Sim cards for everyone involved. That didn't help but made phone calls a bit easier. I'd like to get texting back up and running because it's a lot cheaper to text than to call. I'm not really up on cell phone tech so im sure that im doing something wrong and Google keeps suggesting turning off airplane mode.... Any help would be greatly appreciated.
