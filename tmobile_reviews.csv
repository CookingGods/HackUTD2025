"New Orleans, LA",11/8/2025 0:00,8,"I have been pleasantly surprised by TM! It's coverage and speed beat ATT in almost every area I frequent. Even at the camp. Good thing is if you are in a fringe area or dead zone it creates a uplink to Starlink so your phone doesn't have connectivity as long as you are outdoors. It works to automatically, so there is no manual toggling back and forth. This is really a game changer for cell Services. The service we are on is priced very competitively. Definitely saving us some real $$. My opinion is worth what u paid for it...$0. jJust a heads up! May be worth looking into. We are on the Magenta 55+"

On our second visit to the store, we were fortunate enough to have ** help us. We learned then that this store doesn’t have an official manager. Are they trying to save money? They won’t if they lose **! Who else would work with a rival company for a couple of hours to get the information needed to change a customer over? All the while, helping other associates with their questions and customers. Who else would make us feel valuable as a customer and make what easily could’ve been a stressful interaction, one of calmness and kindness? This was our experience with ** and wherever he goes, we’ll follow, because his knowledge and customer service is that good! Finally, may I suggest again, that he be made a manager officially since he’s already doing a great job at it! Thank you for having T-Mobile at Pryor and good people at this location.

Be aware, don't talk to any of T-mobile's foreign agents, they are robbers and thieves and T-mobile allows this underhanded maneuvering to continue. My service was interrupted. I made a plan to have the service restored, and followed the directions of their representative and they still STOLE the money from my card that was for HOLDING ONLY. DON'T TRUST THEM."

Mario was kind - listened to me - he got what I was saying got on the phone after pulling up both my accounts /he canceled the old account - spoke with the activation dept - got my numbers corrected and I ended up buying a phone from Mario. He took the time to help me - he listens and even though I did not go in to up grade my phone - he made the sale just knowing this nice, kind and profession man - was helping me! Was worth buy a new phone in return!!! Maybe his co worker could learn something from compassion and kindness. Thank you Mario!"

Without my service it could have cost me and my customers money and time. I'm so appreciative to T-Mobile for this and many other things they bring to the table. For me ""A grumpy old man!"" To say this is very rare! Thank you T Mobile!!!!"

I wouldn’t, that makes no sense. They are doing something fishy and not honoring the original contract we signed and I can't find the original paperwork anywhere. All they have is papers we signed electronically just the name typed out, even though I know we signed for everything in the store, so how does that happen?"

After arguing with them, they brought the bill down to around 118 dollars. They are mega corporation scum. Do not trust this thieving company. Go with companies like Lycamobile."

So I comes back and still no modem. So I ask for the Mgr and he has this don't care attitude after I told him what happened. He never assured me or apologized for this. I had to follow him just to talk. He wouldn't even stop and reassure me on anything. I have did business at this store several times and will not be going back there. I'm currently waiting on the regional Mgr to reach out to me. Meanwhile I called the one on Tennessee St and got excellent customer service. They earned my business.

I have now spent 6 hours on this trying to get resolved. Imagine getting charged for a promo and never getting the promo but still getting charged.

I paid…. My credit score had been 820 and it went down to 670…I paid a bill I  did not owe, I was given no notice that there was a problem. No one emailed me on the same email I had communications on with T Mobile for years. 26000 emails (it worked fine) No letter, No call Zip. I had called T Mobile so many times that when I asked the fellow at CS if this happens his reply was tens of thousands... It would seem they sweep their accounts and off you go to collections. I’m 78 years old, have perfect credit before T Mobile got finished with me. I’m not angry, I’m disappointed at their Greed and lack of due diligence. It's really a statement as to their business practice. It's disgusting, I'm retired and debt-free, God only knows what happens to others. I filed a report with my state's Attorney General but we all know that will go in a dead letter file, but maybe I can help others avoid this scam. Yes my collection will fall of in 2032, hopefully prior to my drooling in a bowl of oatmeal at an assisted living facility. Just be careful, this is not a decent Company, they have lost their way.

I also requested a copy of my account (3 times) which would have included all correspondence including a copy of the letter that stated cell phone service was paid up front. Of course I never received it. At this point they turned it over to a collection agency (Service Receivables Management) who is complicit in this fraud.

She also tried to tell us everything was closed but a free line wasn't, which we never had access to or even had a phone or sim card supplied. Between carriers they failed to close the account completely when we signed documents that they were. All I wanted was credit to us since changing carriers in April and all I'm getting is rude and unhelpful reps. I asked to talk even higher up about this and they said sure it will take 72 hours to hear from anyone so keep an eye out on your phone for a call. This is very unprofessional and unacceptable that there is no one that can help with any of this and you have to patiently wait at your phone for a call from someone. We came in on a day off in person to get this resolved. I work a high stress environment healthcare job. I can't be by my phone every minute waiting for a call and dropping what I'm doing.

Since I canceled the number, I could not get the verification code. Since I couldn't get the verification code I could not log into pay the bill.

Then it happened again a couple days later and I called back again and this time I was told there was a tower down and it wasn’t going to be replaced so there was no longer service at my address, but they still were taking my money and not telling me they did not cover my area anymore.

"Chicago, IL",10/31/2025 0:00,2,"T-Mobile didn’t just disappoint me, they turned my life upside down. What started as excitement to save money quickly became a nightmare I couldn’t escape. I trusted their promises, believing the plan would help keep my budget stable and my family connected. Instead, my bills started piling up with charges no one could explain, and every call to customer service felt like being gaslit by people trained to say “sorry” and nothing else. At the worst times, my service would just shut off—no warning, just vanished. I missed critical work calls, family emergencies, and felt like I was losing control over my own life. The stress kept me up at night worrying if I’d made a huge mistake signing up in the first place. T-Mobile didn’t just take my money; they took my peace of mind. No one should ever feel so helpless and betrayed by a company that claims to care. If you value stability and honesty, stay as far away as you can."

I've been waiting for the pixel 10 pro 256 GB. It's still not carried at any store around me within 300 mi online. They only carry the 128 GB. The funny thing is is you can go to boost Mobile which is not a big carrier and they have the pixel 10 pro. You go to Verizon. They have it so you go to AT&T. They have it. It's just really hard to get a phone from T-Mobile unless you purchase it straight from the manufacturer. You would think for being a big carrier like they are that they would be up to date on all the new technology but they are not. I really hope that changes soon because I don't want to have to change carriers again.

It was easy. My phone a REVVL 7 5G has been terrible from the start. Have had to go to the T Mobile store, have had to call which is impossible. The phone has not worked since Friday afternoon and it is Sunday. Promised call backs. But none. They cannot send texts to verify me because it does not work. Went to the store yesterday. A friend took me because I cannot drive. And I have a severely disabled son at home. They did nothing. And told me no store could. The phone was purchased January 27, 2025. I will be sure to make it my business to let all the media outlets here in St. Petersburg Fl. know how dangerous this is because of my son. Oh and I am 80 years old and am trying my best. T Mobile should be ashamed of their phones and their service. It was not like this before."

I was incredibly embarrassed and really glad that we didn't decide to go to a restaurant and have this happen. But now I had to contact customer service, AGAIN, to resolve this issue. I was subsequently told that I was billed for Aug/September month of service, which I didn't even order until 9/23/25- never activated or opened equipment. Then the CS rep said ""It 'may' affect your credit, as the payment was over 30 days late."". I got LIVID - I said ""Absolutely not! If this impacts my credit in any way, we're going to have a VERY BIG problem!"" - First, no payment should have been due whatsoever- much less for a billing period before I even ordered the service. Second, the auto-pay should have never been deducted from my account for service that was cancelled and I was expecting a refund for! So now, I have to wait an additional 1-3 business days for the credit to reflect on my bank account and hope to God I don't incur a 30 day late payment report on my credit."

My bill kept going up, so I removed paid add-ons (like Netflix) in my account. The services stopped working right away — but my next bill still charged me for them. When I called, customer service basically told me it was my fault for removing the add-ons myself instead of calling them, and that “add-ons aren’t prorated.” I was told I’m supposed to cancel exactly at the end of the billing cycle, or I get billed anyway. After 23 minutes on the phone they finally issued a “one-time courtesy” credit. At this point T-Mobile feels like any big telecom: higher prices, blame the customer, no loyalty. I’m planning to move my lines elsewhere."

I can't order a Lyft/Uber cause the PHONE ISN'T ACTIVE!!! They then say we'll add an authorized user to your account and they can go to the store and activate it. FIRST of all I live alone. There is NO ONE I can send. So moral of the story I just wasted 250$ in THIS economy and no longer have a phone. NEVER use Tmobile. Their service and customer service SUCK!!!!

They’ve been charging me for international calling since 2022, even though I canceled it a few months after getting WhatsApp. Somehow, they have no record of my cancellation and have been adding an extra $15 to my bill every month for three years. When I called today, I was told it won’t be fixed until November 8 — the exact same line I was given three years ago. The only “resolution” offered was two months of credit and $10 off per month, after already taking more than $500 from me. The craziest part? The issue still isn’t fixed, and T-Mobile can clearly see that my international calling usage has been zero for the past 90 days. T-Mobile, please make this right."

"Henderson, NV","Oct. 19, 2025 WARNING",9,"1. Baited With Lies, Trapped With Fees They roped me in with a promotional offer they had no intention of honoring. “Free phone with trade-in,” they said. “No activation fees.” “Guaranteed coverage.” Not a single one of those claims turned out to be true. When I brought it up? Suddenly the promotion “didn’t apply to my area” or “wasn’t properly applied at signup.” Their answer? Too bad — pay up or face penalties. 2. Customer Service is a Joke (If You Can Even Reach Them) Calling T-Mobile support is like entering a black hole. You explain your issue five times to five different reps, none of whom can access the same notes. Promises of callbacks and escalation are just empty scripts. You’re met with fake apologies and robotic empathy, but never any actual solutions. It’s like being told “we care” while they stab you in the back with another fee. 3. Dispute Resolution is a Total Scam Tried to escalate my issue? Good luck. Once they’ve got your money, they hide behind “terms and conditions” you never saw. Disputes go nowhere. You're either ignored, misdirected, or gaslit into thinking you misunderstood the offer. They turn their own false advertising into your mistake. 4. Product Guarantees are Meaningless Their so-called satisfaction guarantee is a trap. I returned a device within the window — in perfect condition — and still got hit with a “restocking fee,” late return charge, and mysteriously lost trade-in credit. You can beg, plead, provide receipts — they don’t care. Once you're in the system, you're just another monthly dollar sign. 5. Deliveries and Timelines? Completely Unreliable! If they tell you “2-day shipping,” expect two weeks and a dozen excuses. “The system glitched,” “warehouse delay,” “shipping partner issue,” — they have a script for every delay. Meanwhile, your bill starts immediately, whether you have the product or not. 6. Threats, Penalties, and Intimidation Tried to cancel after being completely misled? They hit me with a termination fee, an equipment non-return fee (even though I returned the device), and a threat to send it to collections if I didn’t pay immediately. All because I refused to keep paying for a service they failed to provide. BOTTOM LINE: T-Mobile is a dishonest, manipulative company that uses false advertising to pull you in, delivers none of what they promise, then holds you financially hostage when you try to leave. If you value your time, money, sanity — run. There are far better carriers out there who treat their customers like people, not ATM machines. I wish someone had warned me before I made the mistake. Consider this your warning."

I moved in with my daughter and son-in-law. They have received checks from any and all utilities that have needed to refund money. They came within the first two months as checks or returned credit.

One of those lines had already been disconnected a month earlier, and I only needed the unlock code for the other phone so I could switch to a different carrier. During my call, I clearly stated that I wanted the entire account closed. However, T-Mobile only canceled one number and left the other line active — without my knowledge or consent. Now I’m being told I owe $262 for a service I did not use and specifically requested to be canceled. I do not believe I should be held responsible for this charge. I acted in good faith, followed the proper steps, and trusted that T-Mobile would handle the closure correctly. I hope T-Mobile reviews my account history and corrects this mistake."

Again another adjustment fix the data charge so I wouldn't be charged going forward. I was told all lines are the same on this plan. You can't make this stuff up.

Correct me if I am wrong from a person that has worked in call centers in the past, when there are going to be any changes with services, communication are sent out and just to be sure, cust/serv reps has a script to mention this info to the customers during calls. I was like, ""Wait, you mean to tell me tax was added from last month to this month."" I was so disappointed, disgusted by that point I removed the insurance from the line that was being charged on 2 flipping tiers. The rep told me the amount my November bill will be. I can assure you it will be wrong again. At this point, by November, my family and I was planning to upgrade with 2 new phones, HELL NO. I am unsure who's worse, T-MOBILE or XFINITY. You want phone service, go to VZ/Mint Mobile, because these are the 2 companies I am looking into. T-Mobile has gone to hell."

We filed a formal complaint with the California Public Utilities Commission. We emailed T-Mobile’s Executive Team. We expected a response the next day but received no communications from T-Mobile. The next day, October 15th, we called T-Mobile once more. Again they found no record of the previous two requests to unlock the phone, nor could they find a record of our account. We had the account for 10 years, paying our monthly charges on time every month. We were good customers. We have moved to Europe and simply wanted an esim from a local carrier. We closed our account with T-Mobile in February, 2025 as it was of no use to us here. We are both 76, and we need a phone in order to maintain our safety, and to call for emergency help should we need it. T-Mobile’s customer service is obviously contracted out to a third party whose employees lack adequate training as well as access to T-Mobile’s records of accounts, open and closed. Now we are at the mercy of the CPUC for forcing T-Mobile to comply with the law by unlocking our phone. I would never, ever recommend anyone to use T-Mobile. I consider them unethical."

Instead, my mother began to get past due text messages and became so discouraged that she was in tears. I told my Mom that this had already been handled and that there was nothing to worry about, and that I would call T-Mobile to make sure. I called the store and actually spoke to the lady who helped me (she remembered me bringing in the needed items) but she said she couldn't help me over the phone and said that I would need to come in...again. I explained that it is not easy for me to do this all over again and pleaded with her to help me over the phone...no such luck. So, I drove all the way back to the store and spoke to a gentleman there who said that he couldn't help me because I wasn't on her account. I explained to him that I had been there just a week or two earlier and that I was told that I would be added to her account so that I could help my mother since she was no longer able. He said again, that since I wasn't on the account, he couldn't help me. I showed him my POA documents, but he wouldn't even look at them and just kept saying that he couldn't help me. I asked him if he could call someone else who could, and he said no because he doesn't have access to her account (what?) So I left (not very happily) and called customer service. I spoke to a very nice young man who seemed very sympathetic and apologetic and began to find ways to help me get the POA issues handled. Unfortunately, T-Mobile is not good at working with these things, so I had to go online and print out one of their request forms, complete it, and email back all the POA docs, their form, and send a copy of my driver's license. After I had emailed everything to them, I received a response that it would take them 7-10 business days before they can review it and respond. I just wanted to make the payment!"

I call 6 times, no answer and find the store at 7th Ave not St. He finally answers the phone and I’m frustrated by this time and have 15 min till closing, only to be told he was closing and would not see me. I asked if this was a joke, only to be told I was being hostile and he would have me arrested if I showed up at his store. I’m beyond disgusted by the lack of competence and I have spent 5 days without a phone, which has been detrimental to my hair salon business. I was not offered a lender phone once and have spent close to 15 hours or more, and have gotten no phone which was already paid for. Now I’m not sure what to do. I want nothing to do with this company, it’s been the worst experience of my life!"

As an active duty soldier, there’s no guarantee of receiving pay this month, and I wanted to take proactive steps to avoid financial hardship. Unfortunately, I was informed that no update had been issued to allow extensions for military members. This response was disappointing, especially considering my service to the country. In contrast, my car loan provider approved my extension request without hesitation, recognizing the unique challenges faced by service members during a shutdown. T-Mobile’s refusal to offer similar support has made me reconsider continuing my phone plan with them. It’s disheartening to feel unsupported during a time of need, especially when a simple request for flexibility could make a significant difference."

Be very careful if you switch from to T Mobile from another carrier and make sure you get receipts for everything.

The last straw was when I walked into the store as requested service to activate the phone and transfer pics and other things from the broken phone and this is what the service rep said to me, ""We don't make any revenue doing this"" we ie..T-Mobile and questioned me on why I didn't have it done at the store where I bought it... Not that I had to, but I explained why I choose to buy the phone where I did. I advise him I am a long-time customer, 9 to 10 years, well he let me know he'd been there 20. I was shocked, taken by surprise, couldn't believe someone representing this company with a brazen attitude to say what he said on my way out. I reminded him of his rude behavior and I had just spent $119 for the 3 lines on my account and I will be shopping at the company I bought the phone from now. It's sad that some of these folks out here are so callous when it comes to customer service. I have bought at least 4 phones from them since I was a customer and I even tried the wireless WIFI, it was not for me. As far as I know, there's T-Mobile, Verizon and AT&T in my local area, so narrows things down quite a bit. I am sorry that any company has any person being as willing as this person was to send a long time customer to another carrier. I hope the service is better, I hope folks can get better training on how to treat every customer, because if customers stop coming because of being treated like this young man treated me, they will probably shut down and customers will go some place else."

I call them back again to complain and they say the soonest they can get a technician out is a week in a half. Which is completely unacceptable to be without WiFi for that long. Apparently during the power outage the power plug was damaged. I went to every electronic store in my town to see if they had a similar replacement part. None of the stores carried this type of plug. And I could not find anything like it online either. T-Mobile said they could mail us out a power plug but it would take a week to get to us. We had been without Internet for about 3 days at this point. And we were tired of being lied too and stuck waiting. The whole reason we signed up was because T-Mobile was offering 1st month free and a $300 dollar gift card for new customers. Yet another disappointment we never received the $300 dollar gift card either. I had been calling all month trying to get it. Was told numerous times that it will be in my inbox by this date, then it's gets pushed back to another date and then another date. Complete liars. I do not recommend them at all.

I only have a few more months on the contract and I am already looking to leave after the prior problem I had with cancelling the internet and trying to fix that billing issue.

For example, I have three devices on payment plans that I pay for monthly, however, when I try to look up the remaining balances on them, only the primary device is shown. There's a way to find that info, but it basically requires spending an hour on the app clicking every single button and/or link available until you stumble on it. I also found out recently that, for some reason, I have been paying taxes on two inactive lines for awhile now--lines I do not need or want. Given all of this, I should have known better than to switch to them for internet services, but in a moment of frustration with my previous company, I made the switch. T-Mobile is the absolute worst internet service available. First off, it is constantly cutting out and disconnecting from our devices although the router says that our reception is ""very good"". None of our devices connect automatically to the wi-fi, even though they're set to do so. I have to manually connect our phones, TVs, my laptop, etc. several times throughout the day. I also live in a very, very small house, yet not all of our rooms get reception. When initially connecting to the router, following the directions did not work, so I had to call for help. The tech had me go in the app, and set up a new name and password for our wi-fi, which I did following his exact instructions. Now both the new name and the original name that's printed on the router show up in the list of options. If you connect to the new name, the service is spotty at best, but if you connect to the original, you get a slighty better connection. It absolutely does not make any sense! Sorry for the long review, but if you took the time to read all the way through, please learn from my mistakes and choose a better service, or at least do your own research before committing to T-Mobile. As for my family, we are washing our hands of this company as soon as our devices are paid off. With all the chaos of day-to-day life, having dependable phone and internet services are necessary but should, in no way, complicated life any further."

A month later T-Mobile add over 400 dollars to my bill saying the warranty didn’t accept my exchange due to the hair line crack and that you have to pay for the phone. The problem I have with that is T-Mobile charging over 400 dollars for a refurbished phone that’s worth less than 150. And they won’t even send you back your old phone so you can give them back a phone that’s not worth the price. If I would have known they were going to charge over 400 dollars for an iPhone 11.

If you want to speak with someone and remove the excessive, fraudulent fees first - never mind that T-Mobile has deliberately shut you off early to extort the money from you sooner - you must pay a $10 fee just to speak with an actual person.

Answer, ""It's over there."" I walked over to the section. I stood. Did anyone attempt to engage me in conversation? No. I walked out. I've been with TMobile 20+ years. With customer service of this caliber, perhaps, it's time I chose another provider."

I’m switching to another carrier and was told by TMobile that my account has not been authenticated, and I need to go to the store in order to get my transfer pen to transfer all four of my cell phones. Their customer service representatives are all from India, and you could hardly understand them and they are not helpful at all. Worst cell phone company! Stay away, their service is awful!!!"
"West Chicago, IL",9/24/2025 0:00,24,T-Mobile offers us Hulu for free through our mobile account. This is illusory as the signup process does not work. You must first create an account with My Disney. But My Disney already says they have an account with my email and my wife's email. But the passwords we have do not work and the password reset feature does NOT send an email as it says it will. So you are effectively prevented from actually using the free Hulu account.

I called them twice today. NOTHING can be done because apparently I have under this mess forgotten my pin number. I was told go back to the store... UMMM nope. Not after all that. The woman also told me finally after complaining profusely that I needed a pin reset. I AM 99% sure that I have done this over the phone before. Either way she finally agreed that they would email a link. They did not do so. She also said I qualified for an upgrade and that they would handle this on her end. I never got an email. I called again. This rep and his supervisor both said there is no way to reset a pin on an email. I AM FURIOUS. I literally have NO PHONE. NO WAY TO DO ANYTHING AND THEY COULD GIVE A HOT CRAP. He also said he was not guaranteeing an upgrade because that depended on my plan. Avoid them like a new plague unless you hate money, care, or decent customer service."

Stuck paying $200 bill monthly with no way out even tho I pay the new carrier for the same transferred lines for many months now. W/o the code they say I have no authority over the account, but I’m still liable to the bill on service not provided. This security tactic bondage scam is sickening.

I’ve spoken with countless customer service reps, managers, supervisors, and technicians over the past year, hoping for a resolution. Instead, I’ve been met with empty scripts, repetitive advice, and solutions that lead nowhere. It feels like shouting into the void, with no one truly listening or caring. It’s incredibly disappointing to realize that after two decades of loyalty, my trust in T-Mobile has been met with inefficiency, indifference, and a lack of genuine support. This experience has left me not just frustrated, but deeply disillusioned. Buyer beware— Loyalty means little when issues arise, and you may find yourself navigating the same disheartening path."

My primary request was for immediate assistance in accessing my voicemail and restoring essential phone services, as my business cannot operate without them but they refused to help despite my urgent circumstances. They told me to log in and change my passcode. Frantic at the time, I was unable to remember my password (I rarely log in). I selected ""Forgot Password,"" expecting to receive a link by email. Instead, the screen said a text had been sent to my phone –the phone which is now likely lost at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. I was also told, dismissively, to visit a T-Mobile store, but all New York locations were closed at night. Shortly after, I remembered my password and tried to enter it, but at that point, I was locked out for 24 hours—not just a short time like most companies do. I spoke to someone in tech support, hoping they would lift the block. Surely, technology being what it is today, this can certainly be done, but they refused. Not being able to access your account --especially in such extenuating circumstances is pure madness! This ordeal has left me without sleep, extremely upset, and distressed. I urgently seek not just a resolution for my current situation, but a clear assurance from T-Mobile that no customer—especially someone running a critical business—will have to endure such frustration in the future."

Apparently rendering good customer service does not matter. I'll never buy anything else from T-mobile until they reimburse me for the faulty mobile Hot-spot they sold me which failed after 4 months. I recommend that you do your research and have your own knowledge about their products because some of the sales people at T-Mobile just tell lies, to sell products that are incapable of meeting your needs.

Honestly not only did she not give me any information about my account but refuse to give me the number for collections and decided to give me an incorrect number. She literally decided to give me a 877-251-3780. That number leads to nothing. They have put phones line on my credit which I never used and I’ve told them that I never used this. I never activated the account but yet it’s showing on my credit. I would never use T-Mobile again and I was warned about this company. Don’t ever use T-Mobile.

All I want is the freedom to manage my own phone line — without being at the mercy of someone else’s choices. T-Mobile, it’s 2025.

If I pay the balance to get the phone unlocked I lose this credit. This makes no sense to me as I lose either way. I am only asking for the phone to be unlocked for 11 days to add another eSIM card.

It almost seems like they hope for ignorance and that the customer doesn’t pay attention so they can take more of your money. Be cautious people when dealing with T-Mobile especially senior citizens who may not be computer savvy because they will definitely get you for your money. I’m very disappointed that after 5 years of being a member of T-Mobile that this is how we ended our relationship. T-Mobile the billion dollar company trying to rob customers for a petty $100. The part that really bothered me is that the rep knows it’s their fault but still told me that there was nothing he could do to change the current bill besides give me a $10 credit towards my next 6 bills because their billing system automatically generates??? Well that’s part of the problem and why I’m calling every month about my bill but they don’t want to own their part in it and do what’s right.

Going to another TM Store the fee was waived. Gee Thanks. I ended up with a Samsung phone after being informed the particular Motorola phone was problematic. Many returns. The great deal (?) on the samsung phone wasn't so great. I'm convinced to accept a $75.00 dollar a month plan and the phone is an additional $22 a month. $97.00 monthly for sub-par service.

They won't let me pay the phone off because they know I will switch carriers once the bill is paid. MORALS. The reason I left Consumer Cellular was to lower my $55 dollar bill. Now it's almost $100 for two years. Oh, but we are giving you free Netflix. I've got news for you; Netflix Sucks. TM Sucks.

This afternoon, two weeks later, I receive a notification from my bank that they charged my debit card for a month of internet service that we cancelled 5 days into the free trial. After doing some research, they are notorious for doing this. Some people never get their money back. Other only get part of their money back and another bill. I have filed a complaint with the BBB and will also be disputing the charge with my bank as I have every single email from them proving I was well within the 15 day free trial and that they should have never charged me.

I watch my grandson every day and I logged in on my daughter's TV so the baby could see Cocomelon. Well, after a week, it said I had used all my logins being out of town. That's B.S. Shouldn't matter where the hell I'm at or how many times I log in. I pay for unlimited. The internet is always lagging or completely shutting down. Once our phones are paid for, we are done. Worse internet service I've ever had."

Since the very beginning, I’ve had terrible service — constant “SOS only” and almost no signal in my neighborhood (Little River/Calabash area). I’ve called customer service multiple times, gone back to Costco where I signed up, and even visited a T-Mobile store, but no one has been able to resolve the issue. What’s worse, the Costco manager admitted they knew this area had bad service, yet still signed me into a contract. T-Mobile’s customer service has also been very disappointing. Even though I had autopay set up, they still disconnected my service and then charged me a $70 reconnection fee. This entire experience has been frustrating and feels unfair. Poor signal, poor support, and unfair fees — I would strongly caution anyone considering T-Mobile in this area."

Sorry for personal details, but these were my real life experiences that called for a dependable network. I'm stuck in a contract that involved a 'promo' deal for a new z-flip 6 with a low cost payment plan and it included a 'free' Samsung smart watch as part of the deal. I was slapped with so many surprise fees, including 60$ just to help me transfer my apps to the new phone. I'm bogged down with an approximately 300$ bill every month on a 2 year payment plan. Plus one of the perks of being a T mobile customer is free Netflix, and when I took the 'promo' deal, it cancelled out my free Netflix without even telling me. Which is just stupid. I live out at a lake about 7 miles out of town, and if there are people visiting the lake with their mobile Wi-Fi, it sucks up all of my bandwidth or broadband, whichever one means that my devices load slowly if at all and just buffer forever. This is far from the coverage they advertise and if I can lose coverage at 30 miles from town or have spotty coverage at 7 miles from town, it's BS.

"Antioch, TN",8/23/2025 0:00,2,"T-Mobile, they have been overcharging us every month for a year. We traded in our phone with tracking proof—first they said they didn’t get it, then they said they did. Every month we call, they say it’s fixed, so we don’t worry, then the next month they overcharge us again. We’ve talked to supervisors, tried everything, and still nothing works. How is this allowed?"

I cancelled service 2 months ago and ported to another carrier. They have now charged me 2 more months after that and when you call to try and find out what these bills and charges are for they can't give you that information because you are no longer a Tmobile customer. This makes no sense. I just want copies of bills to see what charges they are trying to charge for. I can't even log in any longer to stop auto payment on the account. Worst customer service ever. Don't make that switch. Stay away from Tmobile if you ever think you may need to switch carriers

When I did I paid the remainder that was owed on the account to take my number with me. A few weeks later I received a bill in the mail for $90 so I called to inquire what this bill was for because I thought I had paid them in full. They said that they are post pay so you use the service for a month and then pay. I was able to get the person on the phone to cancel the last bill. So a few weeks later I received a collection notice for $90 from t-mobile. I called again and they told me that they let you use the service for two months ahead and that this was the last month's bill. No one ever mentioned this to me and to be honest at this point I feel like they are just attempting to squeeze one last little bit of money out of me. This should be illegal.

He was very irritated that I was bothering him again but I said I need to turn on my phone. That's not customer service. He didn't make a big sale so he didn't care. I then called customer service and got a hold of a supervisor which wasn't much help. Oh well, that's the way we do things. Sorry for your inconvenience. Explaining to her that I am possibly their longest living customer meant nothing. I feel that I should be rewarded for being a customer for thirty years in some fashion. Not treated like an idiot when I go into their store. Since that time, I have been told. They're working on customer loyalty perks. Has it happened? No. Since that time, I had trouble with the new phone and call customer service and wasn't happy.

At his suggestion, after hearing my story, he offered to give me a credit of what I paid for that phone when I went to T-Mobile store. He said he had to get approved, put me on hold, then came back and said it was approved. And it would be there as a credit on my account the following Tuesday. His name was Charles. He even sent me a text confirming what we had agreed on. The following Tuesday, no credit..... I looked at my text messages looking for the one he sent and guess what, it had disappeared!!

"Omro, WI","Aug. 17, 2025 I was introduced to T",2,"I received a bill electronically on the first of the month. The first bill listed already listed my charges with a 15-dollar late fee. The bill had arrived in less than 14 days from the start of service, meaning that not only was I being charged a 15 dollar late fee, but I was being charged for the first month which was supposed to be free. I called customer service, and got bounced from supervisor to supervisor to support person. I was told each time that the charges were correct, and I stated that they were not because the first day of service was much less than one month, but I was billed a full month's service when I wasn't supposed to be billed until the next month. This went on for almost 2 hours, sitting on hold and being cut off. I finally gave up and simply paid the charges and the late fee. But it didn't end there. Next month, I receive my T-Mobile Home internet bill via email. Same thing, it shows current charges, a $5 fee for NOT USING AUTOPAY (This WAS disclosed in the contract so no issues) and yes, another $15 dollar late fee. The bill WASN'T DUE YET! IT WAS NOT LATE. I angrily paid the bill. Next month, bill comes. Finally, the bill is $50 plus the $5 manual payment charge. It seems like they finally got it fixed, I logged the erroneous billing errors and was intending to add them up for one time-consuming customer service complaint and or written request. Another month passes. The bill comes electronically via email, on a winter day during a snowstorm, and I arrive home from work at about 10 PM. I wake up the next morning, check my email and there is the email with a link to make payment. Yep, you probably already guessed it. Your bill is past due, we are charging a late fee. Wow you stingy bastards. OK I am a day late, so I simply pay the fee. Done. Never dealt with a company that was so picky. Fine, I will make sure that that bill gets paid on the due day exactly. Bill comes next month. I receive the bill a few days in advance via email. I am again being charged a $15 late fee when the bill is not even due yet. It looks like they double-bill late fees. If you are late once, the next bill is automatically late. This seems like some really bad computer programming, or somebody doing programming that does not understand how billing systems work. The company punishes its customers by fraudulent false billing, then puts the burden on the consumer to correct its errors, spending hours of their time waiting on the telephone. But it still doesn't end there. I moved to a new location in another county. It is rural as well. I brought my device with me which worked there as well.  According to the contract, you must notify T-Mobile of the location change as they apparently have to allocate bandwidth use for the specific tower you are on. I don't know if that is really true. The device worked for a few weeks. Then I kept getting signal but no internet. My new location had available Spectrum Fiber internet. So I decided that it was time to get rid of T-Mobile home internet. So, as I had retained the original box and packaging per the contract, I returned the device to the T-Mobile store and told them I am discontinuing their service. I made sure they deactivated the device. As I was leaving the store, the representative told me to call customer service to close my T-Mobile account. As this wasn't my responsibility, I did not as the device was deactivated and there was no service. I did my due diligence to notify T-Mobile in person that I was terminating service and turned in my equipment per the contract. Oh yes, I get another bill, charging me a late fee and telling me that my phone is going to be disconnected if I don't make a payment. It was a pretty good laugh. I was now being billed for service I didn't have, especially since I no longer possessed the modem device. The message was also suspect because it was discussing phone service. The answer was....DELETE message. I got a second email a month later saying that they were going to disconnect my service. I had the receipt that I had returned the device. Lol, turn off my service.... It is now August of 2025, more than a year later, I receive an email from a collection agency called Sequium. ""We received your email address from T-MOBILE. We are reaching out to you to provide a convenient customer experience. Our service is designed to be your guide to resolving this matter completely. Your T-MOBILE account information is available for your review."" Yep, now they are trying to collect for a bill for service that was not active, because their automated billing system continued to bill for service which was inactive. While credit reporting agencies no longer accept credit information from cell phone carriers, it wouldn't matter anyway because I don't have a credit report and therefore, there is not much they can do. However, there is one thing for sure, I will NEVER USE T-Mobile service AGAIN. WHAT A BUNCH OF FRAUDS! It is one thing to make a billing mistake, it is another to make the same mistake to take advantage of the customer. Time is money, and T-Mobile's negligence in willfully failing to correct errors in billing is a cause for me to sue for damages, including the amount of time spent contacting customer service, as well as negligence in billing for services that are inoperable."

T-Mobile provided a booster so we can now get uninterrupted calls. The booster runs off our Cox internet service. So when Cox has an outage we have no internet or good phone service. For 5 years they’ve been telling us that they are upgrading towers in our area which they said would provide better phone service and we’d be able to get their 5G internet.

To add insult to injury, a “flag” was placed on my account because of the numerous adjustments made, every single one of which was necessitated by T-Mobile’s own repeated incompetence. The sheer lack of accountability, the dismissive attitude toward business customers, and the systemic operational failures make it abundantly clear: T-Mobile for Business is an unreliable, frustrating, and entirely unprofessional service provider."

But if your plan is 25 bucks plus taxes for every new line, you're better off just getting the phone regular price. And again, you need to answer surveys and give them 10/10.

They don’t take no for an answer and they stall the process of actually closing your account until another billing cycle comes around so they can charge you for another full month of service. They prorate your bill when you start with them but refuse to do it when you leave. They take every opportunity to increase your bill. You’re fine as long as you never call customer service to make any changes to your account. I started with a bill around $50. Ended with a $131 cell bill for 1 iPhone (paid off) and 1 Apple Watch (paid off). The only additional thing I was paying for was the Netflix for 24.99 that started out as a freebie. It took me a week to get my account semi-closed.

I also found out I was being charged for a 4th line for an iPad, which I did not agree to and had zero data used. I was overcharged again today because T-Mobile needs 2 or more billing cycles to fix their errors and I will not receive money - which is mine, but instead credit for T-Mobile.

And after spending 2 to 3 hours to get this straightened out it was the same thing the following 4 months and counting. If I billed them my hourly rate for time wasted they would owe me. It just appears that they have no concern for my time wasted to get their errors corrected. And the same errors keep happening month after month.

Now I’m again trying to get this month’s bill corrected, but T-Mobile customer service is telling me they ""can't access"" the previous chat where the lower payment was clearly promised. It’s incredibly frustrating to be held to charges that contradict what was promised during the sign-up process. I was misled into switching, and now I’m stuck paying more, not less.

They just confirmed I made the right decision switching. SO BEWARE IF YOU LEAVE T-MOBILE MAKE SURE YOU DO IT BEFORE THE NEXT BILLING PERIOD OR THEY WILL CHARGE YOU FOR THE WHOLE MONTH. What a disappointment T-Mobile turned out to be. I used to joke I've been with my cell phone company longer than men I've dated or was married. I feel like I just went through a major breakup. At least the divorce was only 90 bucks."

I paid on time before I was supposed to actually mind you. This will be my second payment. I paid my bill before it was due just for them to turn around and say I owe them 40 more dollars. Mind you I paid weeks before it was due. They’re saying they’re overcharging me because the first payment that I made (that was a few seconds before the second payment) didn’t go through because I keep my card locked. How can you charge somebody 40 extra dollars after already paying 400 just because my card was locked the first time I made the second payment right after that and there’s no point that they should be trying to take $40 from a hard-working, single mother that can barely afford the 400 as it is.

Do not ever do business with Team Mobile unless you want to spend all your time on the phone trying to get your money back every month. I am a senior citizen and in January 2025 I had a credit card fraud done on the credit card that I had online with Team Mobile. I also have paperless billing with them so if there is a challenge they said they text me the information. They turned my phone off for nonpayment because I had credit card fraud and my credit card failed. More I called them 5 minutes after the phone was turned off. They put me through an hour in a half of badgering me. I proved to them that I had credit card fraud, and they would not remove the over charges or the increase charges, and I finally got the phone back up and going. They overcharged me, raised my bill without ever sending me a text to let me know and would not return the overcharged fees.

She was rude, disrespectful and horrible. She said that they would only give me back 2 months of the overcharges and I had to pay the other 3 months of overcharges. This is just another way for Team Mobile to CHEAT THEIR CUSTOMERS AND OVERCHARGE THEM. I think they are the worst company there is. The reason they did this is so they could get your debit card and not a credit card. Team mobile has been hacked many times and if they get you checking account you cannot get that money back. Worst thing in the world for a senior citizen"

Then, when I discovered the no-coverage problem, another half-day trying to troubleshoot over the phone, with the engineering department making me list a number of addresses where there was supposed to be coverage on the map, but where I couldn't make or receive calls. Turns out, they don't actually have coverage there, but they are ""looking into expanding it."" First, I was told to wait 5 or 6 weeks. By end of long conversation, I was told to check back in 1 or 2 weeks or the engineer would call me on Friday (in a few days). Didn't happen. Meanwhile, I switched back to Verizon. So I paid my ""final bill"" over the phone with T-mobile, then turned in my unused iPad device in their required window. I had had to keep using my old iPhone 14 because they couldn't activate a new one over the phone, and I wasn't going to drive 90 miles to a store. Long story short, after I cancelled, I did drive 90 miles to a store, tried to turn in my iPad and the store, even though it was an official corporate store, could only help me print out a label as a courtesy, so I could drop it off at a UPS store. Okaay. So today, almost a month later, I get a bill for device protection. I logged in to my T-mobile account. My login still worked. It showed I had a negative amount, a credit, balance. I online-chatted. They could not see that I was logged in. I sent him a screenshot of the negative balance. I had to keep trying with a passcode after I was sent a form; rep could still not see that I was logged in. Then popup said with too many incorrect attempts my account would be locked and I would have to drive to a store (90 miles away). The rep insisted there was no other solution. I asked for a supervisor or phone number. Got the same story from a supervisor by phone. Altogether I wasted about 2 hours on this. I verbally gave the same passcode to the supervisor, and it worked. She said I had a refund coming. What about the bill I got in the mail today (a month later after cancelling)? Disregard. Can I can a confirmation? No, sorry. And, if my passcode would not have worked I would have had to drive 90 miles to a store. I was considering ordering home internet from T-mobile since they have a tower in town. Nope. After this series of horrible customer service fiascos — I'm not faulting the individual agents, just the policies — I will not be a future customer. Everyone in this area says the same thing, so T-mobile can keep spending big marketing dollars on us, but they are not gaining any long term customers."

I was supposed to receive three iPhone 16e devices, and instead they shipped two Samsung phones and an older model iPhone. How does that even happen on a brand new, documented order? When I called customer service, I spoke with a supervisor named Mark (Operator ID: **) who admitted it was their error, but told me my only options were to: • Wait for the phones to be misdelivered and stolen or returned, • Or pay $14.99 out of pocket to attempt to reroute the package via UPS myself. Why should I have to pay to fix THEIR mistake? Then, the inevitable happened. At 1:55 PM on July 26, someone fraudulently signed for my package at the old address—impersonating me. I filed a police report (Report #**) within the hour. T-Mobile told me they would “follow up on Monday.” Apparently, a theft and identity fraud case isn’t important enough to address over the weekend. To recap: • T-Mobile sent the WRONG PHONES • To the WRONG ADDRESS • Allowed someone ELSE to sign for them • Then refused to act urgently even after a police report was filed • Told me I would have to pay the taxes again if I wanted to reorder the phones in store • Offered no real accountability, no urgency, and no guarantee they would make this right T-Mobile has proven themselves to be irresponsible, disorganized, and completely untrustworthy. If this is how they treat new customers—sending expensive phones to incorrect addresses, ignoring fraud, and still asking for more money—imagine how they treat long-time customers. I’ve also contacted UPS, the Orange County Sheriff’s Office, and Fox 35 News. Someone needs to hold T-Mobile accountable. If you value your money, your time, or your identity: stay far away from T-Mobile."

Paraphrasing but that is the basic response. I am definitely changing carriers and will never ever go back to T-Mobile. Service is not really that good, it is slow and service cuts out often.

"East Syracuse, NY",,3,"Original Review: July 26, 2025 I recently had a problem with my phone, so I went to Walmart to get a temporary phone. They recommended T-Mobile since they had a special of ‘free phone’ with a sign-up service. Walmart sold me the package for $54. Three days later I call T-Mobile to get the account & porting pin numbers and asked again if I had to return the phone – NO. Okay, I have the phone which is useless to me since I got the phone I wanted and switched back to my preferred carrier. I then got a bill from T-Mobile stating that I owed them 1 month of billing service. I called and not one person could give me a reason as to WHY I was billed for a *SECOND* month that I did not use. I only had the phone to use for **THREE DAYS**. Their billing cycle is the 19th – 20th (ex: June to July) and not informed of this otherwise I would have waited 1 day to get the phone. I called in to verify what was happening and was told that they would zero out since they could see I had the phone for only 3 days. But I later got a bill stating that I owed them for the phone (told it was $50 but the bill was for $67), plus the month of July (which I did not use) and late fees. Every time I called in, I asked if I had to return the phone and each reply was NO. I do not understand why everyone told me it was free and to keep but then I billed for it. When I called and spoke with a manager in their billing department, I was told that I should return the phone to Walmart and have them call T-Mobile and they would help resolve the issue. I asked if anyone at T-Mobile would be in the office to handle this and was told YES. Guess what? They lied. No one is in the billing office on weekends. Also, be advised that Walmart’s policy of returning the phone is **15 days** and I was not advised of it. T-Mobile would not send me an RMA label to return the phone whereas other companies do. Sounds like they are trying to accuse me of stealing their equipment. T-Mobile is trying to force me to pay $79.11 for a service I did not use. I did not request a refund when the actual amount for billed services was $1.80. T-Mobile offers may sound good, but BUYER BEWARE!!!"
